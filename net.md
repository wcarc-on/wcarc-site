### Tuesdays 2100hrs on 144.250MHz USB

This net meets most Tuesdays at 2100 hours on 144.250MHz USB (upper sideband).

To the extent possible, both horizontal and vertical polarization will be monitored during the net, although horizontal polarization is the generally accepted standard for SSB and weak signal work.

This is an informal net, open to any and all licenced amateurs who wish to check in. Operators are invited to test their station equipment, experiment, and discuss items of interest to other radio amateurs.

After the net on 144.250MHz, we will hold a quick roll call on 50.150MHz, then 432.150MHz, then other bands including 222.150 MHz, 903.150MHz and 1296.100MHz if stations are interested.

Members of the net are usually available to conduct or assist with special tests on antennas, other modes such as CW and FM and also using digital modes such as PSK31, SSTV, WSJT.

Net Control tries his best to have the entire net and roll calls over by 2215hrs so the demand on your personal time is kept to a minimum.

Regular Net Control Stations include:
* VE3CVG - Rick - located in FN25hm
* VE3XRA - Glenn - located in FN25dj

We look forward to chatting with you. Please join us.
