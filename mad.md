**Second Microwave Activity Day of 2024**

**August 3, 2024, 10:00 – 12:00**

On Saturday, August 3, 2024, between 10:00 – 12:00, the West Carleton Amateur Radio Club (WCARC) will be having a Microwave Activity Day (MAD) on the grounds of the [Diefenbunker: Canada’s Cold War Museum](https://diefenbunker.ca). The Diefenbunker is at [grid square FN15xi](https://www.levinecentral.com/ham/grid_square.php?&Grid=FN15xi&Zoom=13&sm=y).

MADs are events when amateur radio operator microwave enthusiasts get out into the field and set up their portable stations to test, align, and hopefully establish two-way communications with other microwave aficionados. They offer an opportunity to amateurs who are curious about microwave operations to learn more. All are welcome. We hope to see you there!

The first Saturdays of the month are traditional MADs for the [Rochester VHF Group](https://rvhfg.org/wpr/) and the [Ontario VHF Association](https://ovhfa.org/OVHFA/index.html).

SKEDs are encouraged! The WCARC web site will have more details soon.

Although entitled a microwave event, frequencies from 50 MHz and up will be welcome. Since we will be at the Diefenbunker, which is a National Historic Site, and is [POTA Park CA-5083](https://pota.app/#/park/CA-5083), portable HF operations will be encouraged as well.

As more details become available this event announcement will be updated.
