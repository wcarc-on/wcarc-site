title: Minutes - Meeting of January 4, 2005
---
Another gala meeting of the WCARC was held on Tuesday, January
4, 2005 at Ken's lab in Stittsville.  The December 2004 meeting had
been cancelled due to an excess of normal Ottawa weather.

Present were:

The meeting followed its usual generally unstructured format, and a
wide variety of subjects and projects were discussed.

Manfred, VA3WK, presented the Secretary (me) with a handsome
pen, suitably inscribed by the WCARC, as an inducement for me to
avoid procrastinating unduly (or forever) in writing minutes of club
meetings.  This is truly a fine writing instrument, in green and gold -
my old school colours!  Many thanks, Manfred.

Manfred showed the latest iteration of his design for the APRS
message readout prototype with TNC and GPS receiver in the box,
and a four-line display - very neat.  This can attach to a PDA with a
serial port.  This project is nearing completion.  Many of us will want
to build one of these.  Additions or modifications suggested were a
keyboard, weather information display, or remote control and display
using a wireless PDA.

Graham, VE3BYT, showed the almost-completed 902 MHz Yagi that he is
constructing.  This is 7 elements, only about 24 inches long, and designed for
vertical or horizontal polarization.  It is built inexpensively on a wood boom and
uses the simple trombone match for 50 ohm coax.  Details are on the Antennas
page on the WCARC 902 Band Project site at
[https://www.slvrc.org/902band/](https://www.slvrc.org/902band/) and
also on Rick's "How to build Cheap Yagis' page at
[https://ve3cvg.webqth.com/antennas/cheapyagis/index.html](https://ve3cvg.webqth.com/antennas/cheapyagis/index.html).
Graham told Kieran, VA3KS, that he is "still working on the "Lindenblad antenna".

Our visitor Bob, VE3AKV,  became a member of the club.  An
initiation fee was briefly considered for new members, but this was
waived (waved) by Rick, VE3CVG, (with his regal right hand).

Ken, VA3KA, mentioned that some revisions are needed at the bank
in view of the changes in the executive.  The club still has nine 900
MHz amplifiers on hand and available for sale.

Doug VE3XK, gave us a rundown on further details on the RAC
insurance for members and the implications for club coverage.  Not all
details are available as yet.  A club fee of $50 is likely if all club
members are also RAC members.  There will be a surcharge to the
clubs for non-RAC members.  Details will have to be worked out for
WCC family memberships when not all in the family are also members
of RAC.  Club treasurers can do an RAC membership check at the
Information Centre on the RAC web site.  There was much discussion
about potential situations where the club could become liable for
damages and so on.

Again, members expressed appreciation to Rick, VE3CVG, for his
makeover of the WCARC web site.

We were reminded about the VHF/UHF Contest coming on Saturday
and Sunday, January 22 and 23.  Tom, VA3NFA, for some reason
declined to go mobile and be a Rover this time, mentioning something
about it being January, in Canada.

Richard, VE3UNW, showed us a pocket size fluorescent lamp from
Lee Valley Tools, about the size of a deck of cards.  This would be a
very useful gadget for camping, and for reading a book or operating a
rig under the covers. It's only $4.95, and it operates on two AA cells.

Ken, VA3KA, hinted that the Hinternet on 2.4 GHz has been very
stable.  At present seven stations are on.  Throughput may become
an issue with the ISP.

Richard, VE3UNW, indicated that about 40 volunteers will be needed
for the Canadian Ski Marathon the second weekend in February, the
12th and 13th.  Richard also reported that Mike, VE3FFK, would be
holding a course on Net Control on Saturday at Algonquin College.

The meeting was adjourned at about 9:15 PM.

Graham Ide  VE3BYT  
Secretary.

Note:  Rick, VE3CVG, returned the Linx Modules Evaluation Kit to the
club.  This kit was in turn borrowed by Graham, VE3BYT.
Further note:  The Rx and Tx manuals are no longer in the box.  I
have these as Adobe .pdf  files.  I will put them on a CD with the
Evaluation Kit when I return it.  VE3BYT.
