<strong>Old Business:</strong>
<br>Glenn VE3XRA reported that the proposed purchase of a data projector for club meetings in 2011 did not take place because the item discussed at the previous meeting, that had been on sale but out of stock, was never restocked. The meeting discussed requirements and available projectors and came to the conclusion that more than the $450 planned expenditure would be required. <br><br>As notice had been given to formally consider the expenditure at this meeting, VE3XRA moved, seconded by Marc VA3DRV that the meeting authorize purchase of a projector at a cost of up to $600. The motion passed. (Webmasters note - Marc Pichette is shown as a guest. If this is correct he cannot second a motion.)<br><br>
