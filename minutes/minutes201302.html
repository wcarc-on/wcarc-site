presentation on the 1296MHz amplifier that he designed and built.  Room reservations for the usual meeting place have been made for the April and May
meetings and no difficulties are expected for future meetings.

<br><br><strong>President's Report:</strong><br>
None
<br><br><strong>Old Business:</strong><br>
Glenn MacDonell (VE3XRA) reported on possible options for easily and inexpensively adding capabilities for a new band, 3.4GHz, for the club's participation
in the ARRL June VHF QSO Party (the annual Grid Expedition to FN04xa).  There is no obvious solution and he will continue his investigation.
<br><br><strong>New Business:<br>
  </strong>None
<br><br><strong>General Reports and Announcements:</strong>
  <br>
  <strong>Beacons:</strong><br>
  Doug Leach (VE3XK) reported that the WCARC beacons (6m, 2m, 1 1/4m, 70cm) continue to operate nominally. Rick Bandla (VE3CVG) has obtained beacons for 903MHz and 1296MHz
and has located them at a central location in downtown Ottawa. Several members reported hearing their signals around the region.
<br><br><strong>Grid Expedition</strong>:<br>
Al (VO1NO) reported that planning continues for the mid-June, 2013 Grid Expedition and invited members to participate either for the entire event or for a part
of it.

<br><br><strong>Presentation:</strong><br>
Dave Goodwin (VE3AAQ) gave us a presentation on his amateur radio activities in China and neighbouring countries in SE Asia and Oceana during his
two year posting to China.  He outlined how  local regulations affected the ease with which visiting radio amaateurs could obtain local licences and operate
and described his results participating in contests from several different countries.  He found friendy amateurs eager to help in all countries, formed
lasting friendships and appreciated the significant differences radio amateurs face in finding opportunities to operate. In countries and major cities
where almost everyone lives in an appartment condiditons are very different from what we are used to!

<br><br><strong>Adjournment</strong> <br>
  The President stated
  that there being no further business, the meeting was adjourned before midnight.
