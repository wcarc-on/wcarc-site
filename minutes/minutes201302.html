Glenn MacDonell (VE3XRA) reported on possible options for easily and inexpensively adding capabilities for a new band, 3.4GHz, for the club's participation 
in the ARRL June VHF QSO Party (the annual Grid Expedition to FN04xa).  There is no obvious solution and he will continue his investigation.

<BR><br><STRONG>General Reports and Announcements:</STRONG>
  <BR>
  <strong>Beacons:</strong><BR>
  Doug Leach (VE3XK) reported that the WCARC beacons (6m, 2m, 1 1/4m, 70cm) continue to operate nominally. Rick Bandla (VE3CVG) has obtained beacons for 903MHz and 1296MHz 
and has located them at a central location in downtown Ottawa. Several members reported hearing their signals around the region.
<BR><BR><strong>Grid Expedition</strong>:<br>
Al (VO1NO) reported that planning continues for the mid-June, 2013 Grid Expedition and invited members to participate either for the entire event or for a part 
of it.
  
<BR><BR><strong>Presentation:</strong><br>
Dave Goodwin (VE3AAQ) gave us a presentation on his amateur radio activities in China and neighbouring countries in SE Asia and Oceana during his 
two year posting to China.  He outlined how  local regulations affected the ease with which visiting radio amaateurs could obtain local licences and operate 
and described his results participating in contests from several different countries.  He found friendy amateurs eager to help in all countries, formed 
lasting friendships and appreciated the significant differences radio amateurs face in finding opportunities to operate. In countries and major cities 
where almost everyone lives in an appartment condiditons are very different from what we are used to!

<BR><BR><STRONG>Adjournment</STRONG> <BR>
  The President stated 
  that there being no further business, the meeting was adjourned before midnight.
