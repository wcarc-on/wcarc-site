<strong>Opening: </strong>

The meeting was opened by President Al Penney(VO1NO) at 19:30 hours.

Apologies were received from the Secretary Glenn Macdonell and the Treasurer Ken Asmus for their absence.

<br><br>
<strong>Secretary's Report: </strong>
<br>

The Secretary not being present, the President gave notice that the Minutes of the previous meeting were on the web-site and asked if there were any additions or corrections. It was pointed out that Mark Pichette was showing as a guest and not correctly as a member and should be corrected.

It was proposed that the Minutes be accepted, subject to the above change, by Graham Ide and seconded by Bernie Madore.

<br><br>
<strong>Treasurer's Report: </strong>
<br>
It was reported by the President that the club has approximately $1080 presently in the bank.

<strong>Old Business: </strong>

It was reported that there has to date been no success in purchasing a projector for use at the meetings of the club, for which $600 has been previously approved for the purchase thereof.

<strong>General Reports: </strong>
<br>

<strong>Beacons:</strong>
<br>
Doug Leech reported that the beacons continue to operate just fine.

<br><br>
Graham Ide demonstrated a CW IDer based on a micro chip controller that could be used to replace the present IDer that drops a dit.

<strong>June VHF grid expedition:</strong>

The President advised that the results of the ARRL June VHF QSO party had now been posted on the ARRL web site ( Results )  and that we have dropped to 2nd position in Canada in the Multi-op standings with a VE7 station taking the lead. Poor VHF propagation in the East this year was suggested as one of the reasons for this change in our standings
