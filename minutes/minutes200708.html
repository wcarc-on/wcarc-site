<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Arial'>Ken, VA3KA, noted the good tropo
propagation on 1296 MHz into FN21 and FN06 on the previous Sunday morning. There was good tropo during the VHF contest.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Arial'>There was some discussion of
contest logging, and time synchronizing for activities such as moonbounce.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Arial'>Andy, VE3NVK, showed the
SoftRock-40 kit. </span><span
lang=EN-CA style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The SoftRock-40
is a small, low-cost, good-performing 40-meter &quot;software defined
radio&quot; receiver that plugs into a computer USB port and delivers I-Q audio
signals to the computer's sound card.</span><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:
Arial'>&nbsp; This kit is sold out and discontinued. However, a new iteration of the project is available for
deliveries starting late in November. This is the SoftRock-40 Version 5 with modules for 80-30M and
20-10M. Information is at &lt;http://www.amqrp.org/kits/softrock40/version5.html&gt;.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Arial'>Al showed his assemblies for
control and switching of his phased Beveridge antennas, mounted 8 feet above
ground. Al is looking for 470 and 920
ohm 10 watt non-inductive resistors for the project.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Arial'>(I have a note that Al tried to
propel a cat dragging an antenna wire through a culvert. That couldn't be right, could it?)</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Arial'>The OARC Hamfest (fleamarket)
will be on September 1. The club and
the OARDG will have tables for members' stuff for sale. There will be an RAC session in the
afternoon - a general meeting, plus a Technology Update.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Arial'>Ken, VA3KA, reported that the
DSTAR repeater is working. Preamps have
been ordered for 432 and 1296 MHz. There is an intermod problem on 2M. This may require splitting the 2M equipment off to another site. The link to VE3CZO did not work out. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Arial'>Ken and Rick, VE3CVG, are working
on gateway software with Ying Hum, VA3YH, who can provide a fixed IP
address. There are 10 or 11 users on
DSTAR in the area so far.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Arial'>The 902 band repeater has been
programmed. The tower is up on the site
(YMCA building). It should be
operational in several weeks with eventually about 50 watts to a collinear
antenna.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Arial'>There is reported to be an
amateur (who works on commercial gear) prepared to repair amateur equipment at
$30 per hour - minimum 1 hour, maximum charge 3 hours. Specifics are to be confirmed at a later
date.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Arial'>Brad, VE3BSM, reports that the
APRS network is still on. VE3DVQ is in
and out with an antenna problem. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Arial'>The next meeting will be on <span
style='color:black'>September 4</span>, 2007.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Arial'>Graham Ide VE3BYT&nbsp;<br>
Secretary.</span></p>
