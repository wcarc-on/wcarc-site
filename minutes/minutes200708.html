<p>Ken, VA3KA, noted the good tropo
propagation on 1296 MHz into FN21 and FN06 on the previous Sunday morning. There was good tropo during the VHF contest.</p>

<p>There was some discussion of
contest logging, and time synchronizing for activities such as moonbounce.</p>

<p>Andy, VE3NVK, showed the
SoftRock-40 kit. The SoftRock-40
is a small, low-cost, good-performing 40-meter &quot;software defined
radio&quot; receiver that plugs into a computer USB port and delivers I-Q audio
signals to the computer's sound card. This kit is sold out and discontinued. However, a new iteration of the project is available for
deliveries starting late in November. This is the SoftRock-40 Version 5 with modules for 80-30M and
20-10M. Information is at &lt;http://www.amqrp.org/kits/softrock40/version5.html&gt;.</p>

<p>Al showed his assemblies for
control and switching of his phased Beveridge antennas, mounted 8 feet above
ground. Al is looking for 470 and 920
ohm 10 watt non-inductive resistors for the project.</p>

<p>(I have a note that Al tried to
propel a cat dragging an antenna wire through a culvert. That couldn't be right, could it?)</p>

<p>The OARC Hamfest (fleamarket)
will be on September 1. The club and
the OARDG will have tables for members' stuff for sale. There will be an RAC session in the
afternoon - a general meeting, plus a Technology Update.</p>

<p>Ken, VA3KA, reported that the
D-STAR repeater is working. Preamps have
been ordered for 432 and 1296 MHz. There is an intermod problem on 2M. This may require splitting the 2M equipment off to another site. The link to VE3CZO did not work out. </p>

<p>Ken and Rick, VE3CVG, are working
on gateway software with Ying Hum, VA3YH, who can provide a fixed IP
address. There are 10 or 11 users on
D-STAR in the area so far.</p>

<p>The 902 band repeater has been
programmed. The tower is up on the site
(YMCA building). It should be
operational in several weeks with eventually about 50 watts to a collinear
antenna.</p>

<p>There is reported to be an
amateur (who works on commercial gear) prepared to repair amateur equipment at
$30 per hour - minimum 1 hour, maximum charge 3 hours. Specifics are to be confirmed at a later
date.</p>

<p>Brad, VE3BSM, reports that the
APRS network is still on. VE3DVQ is in
and out with an antenna problem. </p>

<p>The next meeting will be on September 4, 2007.</p>

<p>Graham Ide VE3BYT<br>
Secretary.</p>
