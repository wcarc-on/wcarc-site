<br>

<strong>General Reports:</strong>
<br>
<br>
        <strong>Projects</strong><br><br><strong>Beacons</strong><br><br>Doug(VE3XK) informed members that all beacons were operational. He also described favourable responses from a number of other amateurs encountered during his beacon presentations for other groups.<br><br><strong>D-STAR</strong><br><br>Rick(VE3CVG) reported that Dale(VE3XZT) had made a new robust antenna stand. Ken(VA3KA), Ying(VA3YH) and Rick(VE3CVG) assisted Dale in the removal of the old tilted (west) antenna mount which held the VHF, UHF and the 23CM voice antennas. The new mount, elevates the antennas a couple of feet and they also turned the VHF and UHF antennas slightly. The new antennas and mount are boringly straight. Coverage is now much improved in Cumberland and generally better in all areas, proving that a few inches makes a big difference.<br><br>Progress on Hotspots - one board is partially tested. Connectivity to gateway via internet is working OK. The digital carrier detect board has been received and will be wired into the initial hotspot, but future digital COR's will be a simple LM319 comparator, which should be $24.50 cheaper than the $25.00 digital COR.<br><br>The repeater/gateway site is under construction. Rogers is expanding the cell site and was installing power and equipment in the same room where our systems are installed. Unfortunately, our equipment was covered with concrete dust and drippings from the core drilling equipment. Also equipment, and materials were being piled on our equipment. This has been discussed with the Y and they assure us that we are not about to be evicted and will speak to the contractor doing the work about damaging our equipment and leaving doors unlocked.<br><br>The temperature module is in place and fully operational. We are in the process of adding software to make use of the data. We are monitoring the outside temperature, inside temperature, and computer temperature.<br><br><strong>WCARC Web Pages</strong><br><br>We have refined the WCARC registration page which is accessible from the Membership page/Tab. All members should visit the page and submit a form to ensure that we have your e-mail, address and phone number, etc. The same form is used for application for membership in WCARC and also for application to join the forum or for updating information. If you are already a member, treat your initial form as an update.<br><br>There is no change on the domain name issue.<br><br><strong>St. Lawrence Valley Repeater Council</strong><br><br>Graham - VE3BYT reported that the next SLVRC meeting will be on the 7<sup>th</sup> of November and invited all members to attend.<br><br><strong>Lanark Space Agency</strong><br><br>Barrie (VE3BSB) reported that they have launched 5 balloons and plan another for early November on a Saturday. The LASA is planning a new venting system for their launch from downtown Perth. The approximatley $700.00 cost of each launch is sponsored with the last, by parents of the participants.<br><br>
<br>
