<H2>Minutes - Meeting of January 4, 2005</H2>

<P>Another gala meeting of the WCARC was held on Tuesday, January 
4, 2005 at Ken's lab in Stittsville.  The December 2004 meeting had 
been cancelled due to an excess of normal Ottawa weather.</P>

<P>Present were:
<ul>
<li>John VE3IAO
<li>Rene VA3XK
<li>Les  VA3BZQ
<li>Kieran VA3KS
<li>Barney VA3BGB
<li>Ken    VA3KA (Treas)
<li>Doug   VE3XK
<li>Manfred VA3WK
<li>Dale    VE3XZT
<li>Bob     VE3AKV
<li>Tom     VA3NFA (Pres)
<li>Richard VE3UNK
<li>Rick    VE3CVG (VP)
<li>Graham  VE3BYT(Sect)
<li>Harold  VA3UNK
</ul></p>

<p>The meeting followed its usual generally unstructured format, and a 
wide variety of subjects and projects were discussed.</p>

<p>Manfred, VA3WK, presented the Secretary (me) with a handsome 
pen, suitably inscribed by the WCARC, as an inducement for me to 
avoid procrastinating unduly (or forever) in writing minutes of club 
meetings.  This is truly a fine writing instrument, in green and gold - 
my old school colours !  Many thanks, Manfred.</p>

<p>Manfred showed the latest iteration of his design for the APRS 
message readout prototype with TNC and GPS receiver in the box, 
and a four-line display - very neat.  This can attach to a PDA with a 
serial port.  This project is nearing completion.  Many of us will want 
to build one of these.  Additions or modifications suggested were a 
keyboard, weather information display, or remote control and display 
using a wireless PDA.</p>

<P>Graham, VE3BYT, showed the almost-completed 902 MHz Yagi that he is 
constructing.  This is 7 elements, only about 24 inches long, and designed for 
vertical or horizontal polarization.  It is built inexpensively on a wood boom and 
uses the simple trombone match for 50 ohm coax.  Details are on the Antennas 
page on the WCARC 902 Band Project site at <A href="http://www.slvrc.org/902band/"> http://www.slvrc.org/902band/</A> and 
also on Rick's "How to build Cheap Yagis' page at <A href= "http://www.qsl.net/ve3cvg/antennas/cheapyagis/index.html">http://www.qsl.net/ve3cvg/antennas/cheapyagis/index.html</A>.  
Graham told Kieran, VA3KS, that he is "still working on the "Lindenblad antenna".</P>


<p>Our visitor Bob, VE3AKV,  became a member of the club.  An 
initiation fee was briefly considered for new members, but this was 
waived (waved) by Rick, VE3CVG, (with his regal right hand).</p>

<p>Ken, VA3KA, mentioned that some revisions are needed at the bank 
in view of the changes in the executive.  The club still has nine 900 
MHz amplifiers on hand and available for sale.</p>  

<p>Doug VE3XK, gave us a rundown on further details on the RAC 
insurance for members and the implications for club coverage.  Not all 
details are available as yet.  A club fee of $50 is likely if all club 
members are also RAC members.  There will be a surcharge to the 
clubs for non-RAC members.  Details will have to be worked out for 
WCC family memberships when not all in the family are also members 
of RAC.  Club treasurers can do an RAC membership check at the 
Information Centre on the RAC web site.  There was much discussion 
about potential situations where the club could become liable for 
damages and so on.</p>

<p>Again, members expressed appreciation to Rick, VE3CVG, for his 
makeover of the WCARC web site.</p>

<p>We were reminded about the VHF/UHF Contest coming on Saturday 
and Sunday, January 22 and 23.  Tom, VA3NFA, for some reason 
declined to go mobile and be a Rover this time, mentioning something 
about it being January, in Canada.</P>

<p>Richard, VE3UNW, showed us a pocket size fluorescent lamp from 
Lee Valley Tools, about the size of a deck of cards.  This would be a 
very useful gadget for camping, and for reading a book or operating a 
rig under the covers. It's only $4.95, and it operates on two AA cells.</p>

<p>Ken, VA3KA , hinted that the Hinternet on 2.4 GHz has been very 
stable.  At present seven stations are on.  Throughput may become 
an issue with the ISP.</p>

<p>Richard, VE3UNW, indicated that about 40 volunteers will be needed 
for the Canadian Ski Marathon the second weekend in February, the 
12th and 13th.  Richard also reported that Mike, VE3FFK, would be 
holding a course on Net Control on Saturday at Algonquin College.</p>


<P>The meeting was adjourned at about 9:15 PM.</p>


<p>Graham Ide  VE3BYT
Secretary.</p>


<p>Note:  Rick, VE3CVG, returned the Linx Modules Evaluation Kit to the 
club.  This kit was in turn borrowed by Graham, VE3BYT.  
Further note:  The Rx and Tx manuals are no longer in the box.  I 
have these as Adobe .pdf  files.  I will put them on a CD with the 
Evaluation Kit when I return it.  VE3BYT.</P>
