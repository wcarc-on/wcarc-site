Tom, VA3NFA, greeted
everyone. There were no visitors at the
meeting.

Rick, VE3CVG, reported that the
web site is up to date - with the minutes. He and Ken, VA3KA, are waiting to hear about the requested grant to
support the D-STAR project. They have a
number of radios converted for the 902 MHz band, two receivers for the
repeaters. Rick has a repeater
controller on hand.

The 903 MHz beacon is functioning, apparently with a gain antenna pointed
somewhere towards the south.

Rick mentioned an MFJ base station antenna for around $100 that has 4.5 dB gain
on 2m, around 8 dB on 440 MHz, and about 12 dB on 1290 MHz. This is the MFJ-1532N, 5.5 feet long. (Note also the MFJ-1538 - 4 bands; 2+ dB on 6m, 6+ dB on 144, **7+ dB on 222**,
and 8+ dB on 440 - 8 feet long - $120US.)

Ken, VA3KA, was not at the
meeting but reported a respectable bank balance, $70 received from donations
and sales at the fleamarket at Carp, and a membership of 30 - a record
(recently, anyway).

Tom reported that he had lots of
fun with his Rover in the last VHF/UHF contest. He had 12 contacts on 903 MHz, and worked 4 grids on 10 GHz -
total score around 8200 points. Tom is
looking for a better location in FN24.

Rick showed his 1-watt
transmitter for 10m - home brew. Very
neat.

Rick showed as well a 50 mW transmitter and receiver for ATV. These are frequency programmable in the 1.2
GHz band.

Tom demonstrated his flashing oscillator working in the mid-Terahertz range
(red). Tom showed too his 200 mW
transmitter on 144 MHz, for use as a FOX.

Rick and Ken will be constructing
transverters for narrowband work on 10 GHz. These will be DEMI, 3 watts output. Anyone interested can get in on the order for delivery in January. Cost will be in the $500 range.

Graham, VE3BYT, noted that the
Saint Lawrence Valley Repeater Council will be having its fall meeting in
Brockville on November 4<sup>th</sup>. The club will try to have a representative on hand to report on the
WCARC repeater and beacon projects.

The next meeting will be
on November 7, 2006. Al, VO1NO, will report on his experiences on the DXpedition to
the Magdalen Islands.

The December meeting will feature
the elections for officers, a party and a door prize or two.

Graham Ide VE3BYT  
Secretary.
