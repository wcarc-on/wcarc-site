<p><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>As is usual, prior to
the meeting a few of the stalwarts gathered for dinner at the local Swiss
Chalet. Dale VE3XZT joined us for
chicken but could not attend the meeting because of another commitment.</span></p>


<p><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Doug VE3XK chaired the
meeting in the absence of the President. Doug welcomed our guests Ken and Jean Pierre. Al VO1NO President, Ken VA3KA Treasurer, Barney VA3BGB Secretary
and Rick VE3CVG Webmaster were absent.</span></p>


<p><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Elections will be held
at the December meeting. Doug and Ken
are willing to stand for reelection to the executive.</span></p>


<p><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Doug noted that there
are tower sections available at reasonable prices. See the <a href="../">WCARC web site</a> for
details.</span></p>


<p><u><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Beacons</span></u><span
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>: Doug
reported that the 144 MHz beacon transmitter is on order. The transmitters for the other bands (50,
222 and 430 bands) are in the cabinet and ready to go. </span></p>

<p>Beacon frequencies are:</p>
<ul>
<li>50.009MHz</li>
<li>144.297MHz</li>
<li>222.068MHz</li>
<li>432.358MHz</li>
<li>903.365MHz</li>
</ul>

<p><u><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Repeaters</span></u><span
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>: The
144 and 440 band repeaters are generous gifts from Manfred VA3WK. They are at the tower site of Christie and
Walther near Prospect. There was no
access until recently. Phil VE3CIQ,
Dale VE3XZT and Doug VE3XK carried out an inventory of the equipment on
November 1. The Hamtronics Ider EPROM
is being reprogrammed for the VE3WCC callsign. There is a 1400 watt UPS for the repeaters. This UPS may need a new battery. Doug noted that he site has not suffered a power loss since the famous
Ice Storm.</span></p>

<p><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>The IRLP on the 440
repeater is currently running to VE3LWX near Franktown. It will be relocated to VE3IAO in Almonte in
the near future. Tests have shown a
strong signal at VE3IAO.</span></p>


<p><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>The OARDG DSTAR system
is reported to be working well.</span></p>


<p><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>For upcoming radio
events, see the WCARC web site. Are you
ready for Moonbounce (50 to 1296) on November 29<sup>th</sup>?</span></p>


<p><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Note that the December
meeting on the 2<sup>nd</sup> will be our annual Christmas Party and Election.</span></p>


<p><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Following the business
part of the meeting, Ken Halcrow VE3SRS gave an extensive and extremely interesting
talk on the Canadian Forces Station at Alert NWT, with many photographs. Alert is only 450 miles from the North
Pole. Ken went back to visit Alert for
the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary celebration of VE8RCS/VY0. For decades, phonepatches through VE8RCS
were the only way station personnel were able to communicate with their
families.</span></p>


<p><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>There is an
interesting and comprehensive web site describing the Canadian Forces Station
Alert in the past and present, at <a href="http://jproc.ca/rrp/alert.html">http://jproc.ca/rrp/alert.html</a>. CFS Alert is largely controlled remotely
now, but is still manned to a degree, partly to continue to assert Canada's
sovereignty in the far north.</span></p>
