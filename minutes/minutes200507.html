<p>Ken, VA3KA, has booked the Kanata Room for August.  We'll try for a
few months ahead.</p>

<p>Introductions were made around the room.  Duane, VA3ODD,
suggested joint activities with other hobbies, and noted that OVMRC,
the Ottawa Valley Mobile Radio Club, has a trailer.</p>

<p>Ken gave a financial report.  Costs include RAC insurance,
registration of the WCC domain name, and memberships in Amsat
and Tapr.</p>

<p>The 903 MHz beacon is no longer on the Lee Valley Building at
Greenbank and the Queensway.  Currently it is Tom's, VA3NFA,
basement.  A new site will have to be found, preferably a central
location in the area.</p>

<p>Doug, VE3XK, mentioned the Canada Day Contest.  In the June VHF
contest Ken did very well, and his best ever.  Bob, VE3KZ, had only
one more contact.  The Rover helps a lot for contacts.  Tom worked 6
grids with good conditions including a thunderstorm.  One mast fell
over on the van.  One more rover would be useful.  Schedules should
be made for contacts on 2 meters simplex.  Tom is going to describe
his rover operations at the OVMRC.</p>

<p>Brad, VE3BSM, says that APRS is restructuring.  144.390 is too
congested in some areas, with too many repeats.  </p>

<p>Manfred reported 8 full time users.  It was born of necessity as users
in the boonies were getting about 24K on dialup on a good day.</p>

<p>Rick, VE3CVG, suggested 10 GHz equipment be considered for the
next club project.</p>

<p>Dale, VE3XLT, mentioned the new digital audio box for around $300-
$400 made by AOR.  Several members are interested in experimenting
with this mode.</p>

<p>The meeting adjourned at around 9:20PM.</p>

<p>The next meeting will be on Aug.2, 2005</p>

<p>Graham Ide VE3BYT Secretary.</p>
