We have 25 paid up members and $4050.84 in the bank. $3000 has been invested in a term deposit, maturing in 14 months. The bank balance reflects the purchase of a vector network analyzer and spectrum analyzer approved at the March meeting.

### Old Business

Clayton (VE3IRR) introduced Jeremy (VA3ZTF)'s proposal to amend the Club's bylaws. The proposal is to replace section 10 as follows:

Old:

> Expenditures: Expenditures should be approved in advance, and prior to the actual expenditure. Single expenditures up to $100 may be approved by two Signing Officers and disclosed at the next general meeting. Expenditures exceeding $100 shall require approval by a majority of the members at a general meeting. Expenditures exceeding $400 shall require 2 weeks notice prior to discussion at a general meeting following which a majority vote will be held at the next general meeting.

New:

> Expenditures: Expenditures should be approved in advance, and prior to the actual expenditure. Single expenditures up to **$250** may be approved by two Signing Officers and disclosed at the next general meeting. Expenditures exceeding **$250 but less than $500** shall require approval by a majority of the members at a general meeting. Expenditures exceeding **$500** shall **be presented at a general meeting and opened for discussion on the WCARC email list**, following which a majority vote will be held at the next general meeting.

A final vote will be held on this proposed amendment at the May 14 meeting.
