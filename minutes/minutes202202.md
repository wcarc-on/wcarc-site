### Speaker(s)

- Georges-André (VE2VAB) and the Québec QSO Party. Sponsored by the Club de Radio Amateur de l'Outaouais.
- Karen (VA3IGO): Comparison of HF reception on her three backyard antennas.

### Officer Election

All Officer positions are now filled.
- Vice President: Lawrence (VA3IQ) has come forward as a candidate for the Vice President position. As he is the only candidate for that position, he is elected by acclamation.
- Director: Wayne (VE3CZO) confirmed his candidacy for the Director position. As he is the only candidate for that position, he is re-elected by acclamation.

### Old Business

- VHF/UHF Beacon:
  - Bert (VE2ZAZ) measured the UHF beacon frequency remotely. The objective was to assess the impact temperature has on its transmitted frequency. At +1° Celsius, the frequency was 432.3571 MHz, the publicized frequency being 432.357 MHz. From +1° Celsius to -21° Celsius, he measured a -915 Hz drift. It would then be expected for the frequency to drift upward by about 1 kHz as the temperature reaches +25° Celsius. Considering that it is centred at zero Celsius and that there is an absence of radio congestion on the 432 MHz band, Bert concludes that the existing drift is acceptable, and that there is no need to activate the beacon enclosure heating system.
  - The beacon move is On Hold until we get further notice from the DARC officers.

### Reports / Club Project Updates

None.

### New Business

- Via email from Rick (VE3BK): VE80LAM GB80LAM VK80LAM Special event stations for 80 years since the first sortie from Great-Britain during World War II will take place in March. He would like people to contact him if interested. Charles (VA3CPY) will post the information on the WCARC Groups.io.
- Lawrence (VA3IQ): If the Club intends to participate to the upcoming June VHF contest, we should consider reserving the Corkery Community Center. Bert (VE2ZAZ) suggested that we wait until the March meeting before taking that decision.

### Show and Tell / Announcements

Lawrence (VA3IQ): German Rothammel's Antenna Book. A compendium of more than 1600 pages. Very good.

### Ask the Club

This period in the meeting offers an opportunity to ask technical questions and get answers from knowledgeable Club members.

### Adjournment

The President observed that there was no further business; the meeting was adjourned at 8:40 pm.
