<BR><BR><STRONG>Opening:</STRONG><BR>The meeting was opened by President Al 
Penney(VO1NO) at 19:35 hours. 

<BR><BR><STRONG>Secretary's Report:</STRONG> <BR>Secretary Glenn MacDonell (VE3XRA) introduced the minutes of the previous 
meeting. Moved by Glenn MacDonell (VE3XRA) that the previous minutes as published 
on the web pages, be approved. Seconded by Peter Jago (VA3PJ). Motion approved. 

<BR><BR><STRONG>Treasurer's Report:</STRONG> <BR>Treasurer Ken Asmus 
(VA3KA) reported that the club had 16 paid up members and 3 life members with 
$687.81 on hand. He reminded members that in planning for the year, we need to 
consider that most income arrives at the beginning of the year from membership 
renewals and the largest expense, to RAC for our liability insurance (~$260), 
comes at the end of the year. He also reported that he is continuing to look 
for ways to reduce bank charges, a significant cost for our small 
budget.

<BR><BR><STRONG>Old Business:</STRONG> <BR>The issue of small 
attendance at recent meetings, noted by the Director, Bert (VE2ZAZ) at the 
previous meeting was discussed. This affected our slower than usual renewals 
this year because January marked the beginning of the club's new year. Frequent 
changes of meeting location may have affected this but we were now set in our 
regular meeting place until at least mid-summer. Bert suggested that e-mailing 
of meeting minutes and notice of the topic of upcoming presentations to the 
WCARC e-mail list may help bring upcoming meetings to the attention of 
members. The Secretary, Glenn (VE3XRA) agreed to target such information about 
2 weeks before meetings.

<BR><BR><STRONG>New Business:</STRONG> 
<BR>None

<BR><BR><STRONG>General Reports:</STRONG> 
<BR><BR><STRONG>Beacons</STRONG><BR>Peter (VA3PJ), on behalf of Doug (VE3XK), who 
was unable attend this meeting, reported that the beacons continue to operate 
and their ventilation system has been changed from the winter to spring 
setting.

<BR><BR><STRONG>24 GHz Project</STRONG><BR>Bert (VE2ZAZ) reported 
success in adapting the surplus RF sections of 24GHz speed radars into wide 
band FM transceivers, including changing the mode from circular polarization to 
linear polarization. He will describe what he has done and the performance of 
the systems in a presentation at the meeting in May. 

<BR><BR><STRONG>D-STAR</STRONG><BR>Ken (VA3KA) reported that the 
internet service provider appeared to be the cause of internet 
drop-outs of the VA3ODG repeater located in downtown Ottawa. The service provider is scheduled to be changed on April 20 and local 
D-STAR users hope this will solve the problem. Information on this and other 
repeaters and hotspots serving the Ottawa area can be found on the Ottawa Amateur Radio Digital Group website at <A 
href="https://va3odg.webqth.com/"> https://va3odg.webqth.com</A>.

<BR><BR>The 1.2 GHz anntenna for the high speed data and 
voice D-STAR repeater, owned by the Almonte Amateur Radio Club, has been installed at about 
180ft AGL on the antenna tower at the Union Hall building in Almonte. This 
required relocating the UHF antenna, significantly improving the D-STAR coverage across the region. More 
information can be found on the Almonte ARC website at <A href="http://www.almontearclub.ca/">

<BR><BR><STRONG>Ottawa Antenna Consultation</STRONG><BR>Glenn (VE3XRA) reported that 
the Ottawa City Council had approved its new Municipal Concurrence and Public 
Consultation Process at their March 18 meeting. Representatives of the ad-hoc group 
of radio amateurs from across the Ottawa area, formed to respond to the City 
proposal, met with City staff in March and reached an agreement that met the 
City's concerns for encouraging antennas to be located in less visually 
intrusive locations, while also recognizing the requirements for adaequate 
antennas to serve radio amateurs needs. The City does not approve antennas but 
can influence the decisions of proponents by defining what size and location of 
antenna requires consultation with the city and possible approval by Industry 
Canda vs what can be installed immediately without consultation. The new 
process exempts all wire antennas and focuses on antenna supports. Consultation 
is required for lattice or guyed towers or ony structure higher than 15m if 
located in front of a house, on a lot less than 1 acre in size. These structures, 
and any others, can be installed without consultation if located behind the house 
and less than 18m high, if they meet required set back criteria. Structures up to 
29m high can be installed on lots over 1 acre in size, depending on set back and 
location requirements, that change with lot size. The new Process takes effect 
30 days after the City Council approval (April 27). City staff are now preparing 
their internal procedures and developing public information. Glenn's summary of 
the exemption criteria approved by the City Council can be found in the 
Presentations section of this website.

<BR><BR><STRONG>Presentation(s)/Activity:</STRONG> <BR>Al (VO1NO) 
delivered a presentation on the <STRONG>DXpedition to Bon Portage 
Island</STRONG>, just off the coast of Nova Scotia, last June. The presentation 
can be found in this website's Presentations section.

<BR><BR><STRONG>Adjournment:</STRONG> <BR>The President, Al 
Penney (VO1NO) stated that there being no further business, the meeting would be 
adjourned. The meeting was closed at 21:55 hours.
