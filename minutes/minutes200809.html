Al read the letter into the record;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>June 23, 2008</p>
  <p>Greetings Al</p>
  <p>As promised, here is the "incentive package" for the VE3WCC VHF team, and club.
The caps are for the team, and the maps are for the teams needs first, and club
members also, as you see fit.</p>
  <p>It is my hope that the West Carleton ARC will continue to set a positive example
to so many clubs in Canada who need a role model to look up to, and one who
will at all times maintain contesting integrity and ethics. As you know, we
have some in VE3 who will violate ethics for the greed of higher scores.</p>
  <p>I see your score rose to 86,151. Congratulations to all on the team for an
excellent venture. Hope you took some photos, as I forgot to, OOPS!. Next year
will be even better, and Ryan will cut the hay in the area in advance.</p>
  <p>It gives me great pleasure to offer all of you my support.</p>
  <p>73,<br>Bill Burgess<br>VE3CRU/R</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He included a number of incentives to encourage the
continuing efforts of the WCARC in further grid expeditions. A photo was taken
of available members of that expedition to send along with the clubs thanks to
Bill.</p>
