<P><BR><STRONG>Opening:</STRONG><BR>The meeting was opened by President Al
Penney(VO1NO) at 19:30 hours. The President noted that this would be the Annual
General meeting for 2011 and welcomed one visitor, John Pavelich (VE3XKD).<BR></P>
<P><BR><STRONG>Secretary's Report:</STRONG> <BR>Secretary Glenn
MacDonell(VE3XRA) introduced the minutes of the previous meeting. Moved by
the Secretary that the previous minutes as published on the web pages
be approved. Seconded by Peter Jago (VA3PJ). <BR><BR>Motion approved.

<BR><BR><BR><STRONG>Treasurer's Report:</STRONG> <BR>The President noted
that the Treasurer was unable to attend the meeting but had advised that the
club's financial situation had not changed significantly from that reported at
the previous meeting.<BR><BR>
Webmaster's note: In November, Treasurer Ken Asmus (VA3KA)
reported that since the October meeting WCARC gained one new member. The bank balance was $584. A payment of $246
for liability insurance for next year was due to RAC on December 1st, so we will
enter December 2011 with a balance of about $338. The only
other outstanding expenditure this year was our Christmas party. Membership renewals for the new year begin in January.<BR></P>


<P><STRONG>Vice President's Report</STRONG> <BR>The Vice President noted that the
regular meeting place, Sobey's at the corner of Hazeldean and Terry Fox, in
Kanata, had been available and was selected for the meeting because of its
proximity to restaurants and easy access from the Queensway. Members briefly
discussed the location and agreed that this would be our first choice for future
meetings. It is still not possible to book the meeting room far in advance
(bookings are usually taken 1 week before the meeting).<BR><BR><STRONG>Old
Business:</STRONG> <BR>None<BR><BR><STRONG>New Business:</STRONG>
<BR>None<BR><BR><STRONG>General Reports:</STRONG>
<BR><BR><STRONG>Beacons</STRONG><BR>Doug (VE3XK) reported that the ventilation
system for the 6m, 2m, 1.25m and 70cm beacons has been set for winter
operation and they continue to work well.<BR>Some members noted that the 900MHz
beacon provides a vertically polarized signal and suggested that it would be
nice to have horizontal or circular polarization.<BR><BR>Web master's note: Since the 900MHz beacon is not on the air, the importance of polarization seems somewhat moot.<br><br><STRONG>24GHz
project</STRONG><BR>There has not been much progress recently but as the club
prepares for the next expedition to FN04xa in June 2012 some members will
explore the use of gunplexers for 24GHz
communications.

<BR><BR><STRONG>D-STAR</STRONG><BR>The VA3ODG and VA3AAR repeaters, and all hot spots are working
well. The Almonte group was successful in obtaining support though a Trilliam
grant and is in the process of expanding their repeater system.

<BR><BR><STRONG>Ottawa Antenna Policy</STRONG><BR>Glenn VE3XRA reported that City of Ottawa officials had
advised in early November that development of the proposed policy was taking
longer than originally planned. The original target for a presentation to City
Council Committees was the end of November 2011. It is now expected to be
considered in February or March. They will advise on changes made as a result of
the consultations that WCARC executive members had participated in.</P>

<P><STRONG>Grid Expedition</STRONG><BR>The President noted that the club would
again participate in the ARRL June VHF QSO Party (June 9-10, 2012) with an
expedition to FN04xa overlooking Lake Ontario. Last year saw the greatest
participation yet, and included a mix of experienced and new amateurs. He
encouraged all members to consider participating and noted that for those unable
to participate through the entire period (set up Friday through to tear down
Monday) operators able to share the load during the contest or anyone interested
in assisting or observing the contest were welcome. More details will be
provided as the date nears.

<BR><BR><STRONG>Annual General Meeting - Elections</STRONG><BR>West Carleton Amateur Radio Club Executives are
elected for 2 year term with half of the positions up for election each year. At
this meeting elections were held for the positions of Director, Secretary and
President. </P>
<P>The results were:
<BR>Director: Bert Zauhar (VE2ZAZ) nominated by Graham Ide (VE3BYT). Acclaimed.

<BR><BR><BR><STRONG>Adjournment:</STRONG> <BR>The President
Al Penney(VO1NO) stated that there being no further business, the meeting would
be adjourned. The meeting was closed at 21:10 hours. </P>
<P>Following adjournment the attendees took part in the annual Christmas
Party.<BR><BR></P>
