<p>Tom, VA3NFA, greeted
everyone. There were no visitors at the
meeting.</p>

<p>Rick, VE3CVG, reported that the
web site is up to date - with the minutes. He and Ken, VA3KA, are waiting to hear about the requested grant to
support the D-Star project. They have a
number of radios converted for the 902 MHz band, two receivers for the
repeaters. Rick has a repeater
controller on hand. <br>
<br>
The 903 MHz beacon is functioning, apparently with a gain antenna pointed
somewhere towards the south.<br>
<br>
Rick mentioned an MFJ base station antenna for around $100 that has 4.5 dB gain
on 2 M., around 8dB on 440 MHz, and about 12 dB on 1290 MHz. This is the MFJ-1532N, 5.5 feet long. (Note also the MFJ-1538 - 4 bands; 2+ dB on 6M, 6+ dB on 144, <u>7+ dB on 222</u>,
and 8+ dB on 440 - 8 feet long - $120US)</p>

<p>Ken, VA3KA, was not at the
meeting but reported a respectable bank balance, $70 received from donations
and sales at the fleamarket at Carp, and a membership of 30 - a record
(recently, anyway).</p>

<p>Tom reported that he had lots of
fun with his Rover in the last VHF/UHF contest. He had 12 contacts on 903 MHz, and worked 4 grids on 10 GHz -
total score around 8200 points. Tom is
looking for a better location in FN24.</p>

<p>Rick showed his 1-watt
transmitter for 10M - home brew. Very
neat.<br>
Rick showed as well a 50mw transmitter and receiver for ATV. These are frequency programmable in the 1.2
GHz band.<br>
Tom demonstrated his flashing oscillator working in the mid-Terahertz range
(red). Tom showed too his 200 mw
transmitter on 144 MHz, for use as a FOX.</p>

<p>Rick and Ken will be constructing
transverters for narrowband work on 10 GHz. These will be DEMI, 3 watts output. Anyone interested can get in on the order for delivery in January. Cost will be in the $500 range.</p>

<p>Graham, VE3BYT, noted that the
Saint Lawrence Valley Repeater Council will be having its fall meeting in
Brockville on November 4<sup>th</sup>. The club will try to have a representative on hand to report on the
WCARC repeater and beacon projects.</p>

<p>The next meeting will be
on November 7, 2006. Al, VO1NO, will report on his experiences on the DXpedition to
the Magdalen Islands.</p>

<p>The December meeting will feature
the elections for officers, a party and a door prize or two. </p>

<p>Graham Ide VE3BYT&nbsp;<br>
Secretary.</p>
