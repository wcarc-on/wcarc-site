<p>The meeting began with Tom, VA3NFA, fiddling with the thermostat. At
first the room was cool. Then, it became quite a bit too hot. You
can not please everyone.</p>
<p>Our guest Ed, VE3LZV, introduced himself, then greetings were extended with
members around the table introducing themselves in turn.</p>
<p>Doug, VE3XK, presented Justin, VE3QYR, with a QSL card from Justin's QRP
contact on 40 M. with a station in Troy N.Y. Justin's QRP transmitter is
from Oak Hills Research &lt;http://www.ohr.com/&gt;.</p>
<p>Tom reminded everyone about the Iroquois fleamarket and the VHF Spring in
April (refer to the club web site for details).</p>
<p>Rick, VE3CVG, mentioned the Hamfest at Brampton on the 25th of March.
There will be presentations. This is similar to the format of the fall
OARC hamfest in Carp on Labour Day weekend (September 2). The URL for the
event is &lt;<a href="http://www.ham-ex.ca/">http://www.ham-ex.ca/</a>&gt;.</p>
<p>Rick noted that the links on the club web site have been updated. Rick
will add links to personal pages if he is given the information. Rick will
also put on the site the material from presentations made at club meetings -
either in PowerPoint or .PDF format. As a start, these will include Tom's
presentation on his Rover Activities, Doug's presentation on APRS, and Rick's on
10GHz operating and equipment (tonight).</p>
<p>Rick reported that the 903 MHz beacon is still putting out a good
signal. Graham, VE3BYT, noted that he could hear the beacon on his ICOM
R-7000 receiver using only a 19 inch vertical whip on the dining room table
(Louise was truly thrilled and encouraged me to move all of my equipment into
the dining room).</p>
<p>Graham indicated that the February minutes are on the web site.</p>
<p>Brad, VE3BSM, reported that the APRS digipeaters are operating well. A
software reset was necessary at VE3DVQ - Lavant, and it seems to be OK now.</p>
<p>Tom and Rick showed one of Kent Britain's (WA5VJB) antennas fabricated on PCB
material. They are nice quality and are available in a number of frequency
ranges and designs. These include Log Periodics (400-1000, 900-2600 and
2100-11000 MHz), Yagis (900-930, 915, 1250-1300, and 2400-2450
MHz),<br>and a Quad-Patch antenna for 2400-2480 MHz. The antennas
are small and could be used as dish feed antennas and/or shielded in plastic
boxes (your XYL will wonder where the Tupperware boxes went). The web URL
for Kent's pcb antennas site is &lt;<a
href="http://www.wa5vjb.com/index.html">http://www.wa5vjb.com/index.html
</a>&gt;. The club can get a quantity discount on these antennas and will
consider offering them at various fleamarkets. Tom and Rick will check
prices and circulate members by Email for interest and individual
requirements.</p>
<p>Rick presented a comprehensive talk and demonstration of wide-band radio
communication at 10 GHz, using Tellurometers. This survey instrument was
invented in 1957 by Dr. T. L. Wadley of South Africa. The Tellurometer was
the first survey device using microwaves. With a transmitter output in the
milliwatt range and the built-in antenna with parabolic reflector, the output is
about 12 watts ERP. Because of the instrument design, you need two of them
to talk to each other. The system is full duplex. Rick fired up his
pair of instruments and a number of QSOs were successfully held across the room,
and at many dB over S9.</p>
<p>The next meeting will be on April 4, 2006 when another neat UHF demonstration
is anticipated. </p>

<p>Graham Ide VE3BYT Secretary.</p>
