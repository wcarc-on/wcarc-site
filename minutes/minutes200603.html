<P>The meeting began with Tom, VA3NFA, fiddling with the thermostat.&nbsp; At 
first the room was cool.&nbsp; Then, it became quite a bit too hot.&nbsp; You 
can not please everyone.</P>
<P>Our guest Ed, VE3LZV, introduced himself, then greetings were extended with 
members around the table introducing themselves in turn.</P>
<P>Doug, VE3XK, presented Justin, VE3QYR, with a QSL card from Justin's QRP 
contact on 40 M. with a station in Troy N.Y.&nbsp; Justin's QRP transmitter is 
from Oak Hills Research &lt;http://www.ohr.com/&gt;.</P>
<P>Tom reminded everyone about the Iroquois fleamarket and the VHF Spring in 
April (refer to the club web site for details).</P>
<P>Rick, VE3CVG, mentioned the Hamfest at Brampton on the 25th of March.&nbsp; 
There will be presentations.&nbsp; This is similar to the format of the fall 
OARC hamfest in Carp on Labour Day weekend (September 2).&nbsp; The URL for the 
event is &lt;<A href="http://www.ham-ex.ca/">http://www.ham-ex.ca/</A>&gt;.</P>
<P>Rick noted that the links on the club web site have been updated.&nbsp; Rick 
will add links to personal pages if he is given the information.&nbsp; Rick will 
also put on the site the material from presentations made at club meetings - 
either in PowerPoint or .PDF format.&nbsp; As a start, these will include Tom's 
presentation on his Rover Activities, Doug's presentation on APRS, and Rick's on 
10GHz operating and equipment (tonight).</P>
<P>Rick reported that the 903 MHz beacon is still putting out a good 
signal.&nbsp; Graham, VE3BYT, noted that he could hear the beacon on his ICOM 
R-7000 receiver using only a 19 inch vertical whip on the dining room table 
(Louise was truly thrilled and encouraged me to move all of my equipment into 
the dining room).&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>Graham indicated that the February minutes are on the web site.</P>
<P>Brad, VE3BSM, reported that the APRS digipeaters are operating well.&nbsp; A 
software reset was necessary at VE3DVQ - Lavant, and it seems to be OK now.</P>
<P>Tom and Rick showed one of Kent Britain's (WA5VJB) antennas fabricated on PCB 
material.&nbsp; They are nice quality and are available in a number of frequency 
ranges and designs.&nbsp; These include Log Periodics (400-1000, 900-2600 and 
2100-11000 MHz), Yagis (900-930, 915, 1250-1300, and 2400-2450 
MHz),&nbsp;<BR>and a Quad-Patch antenna for 2400-2480 MHz.&nbsp; The antennas 
are small and could be used as dish feed antennas and/or shielded in plastic 
boxes (your XYL will wonder where the Tupperware boxes went).&nbsp; The web URL 
for Kent's pcb antennas site is &lt;<A 
href="http://www.wa5vjb.com/index.html">http://www.wa5vjb.com/index.html 
</A>&gt;.&nbsp; The club can get a quantity discount on these antennas and will 
consider offering them at various fleamarkets.&nbsp; Tom and Rick will check 
prices and circulate members by Email for interest and individual 
requirements.</P>
<P>Rick presented a comprehensive talk and demonstration of wide-band radio 
communication at 10 GHz, using Tellurometers.&nbsp; This survey instrument was 
invented in 1957 by Dr. T. L. Wadley of South Africa.&nbsp; The Tellurometer was 
the first survey device using microwaves.&nbsp; With a transmitter output in the 
milliwatt range and the built-in antenna with parabolic reflector, the output is 
about 12 watts ERP.&nbsp; Because of the instrument design, you need two of them 
to talk to each other.&nbsp; The system is full duplex.&nbsp; Rick fired up his 
pair of instruments and a number of QSOs were successfully held across the room, 
and at many dB over S9.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>The next meeting will be on April 4, 2006 when another neat UHF demonstration 
is anticipated. </P>
