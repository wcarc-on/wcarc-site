<p>Ken Asmus, VA3KA, Treasurer, was
absent, working in the Great Canadian North.</p>

<p>We were happy to have Ed Blaser,
VE3LZV, and Steve Attfield join with us as guests. Steve is working on
his amateur license. Introductions were made around the table.</p>

<p>Rick, VE3CVG, reported that the
website is up to date, and that the 903 MHz beacon is working well at NRC on
Montreal Road. The Maidenhead Grid location reported by the beacon will
be corrected in the near future. Graham, VE3BYT, noted that he can hear
the beacon at his QTH in Bells Corners on a 19&quot; vertical whip inside the
house. This is at a range of over 21 kilometres.<br>
Rick mentioned that there is a 2 Meter Sprint tonight.</p>

<p>Graham had nothing Secretarial to
report.</p>

<p>Brad, VE3BSM, reported that the
APRS systems are all working.</p>

<p>Tom, VA3NFA, noted that Al,
VO1NO, will coordinate the Field Day activities for the club. Al will
prepare a budget and plans for the event in conjunction with the South West
Lanark North Leeds ARES group.</p>

<p>Dale, VE3XZT, informed the group
that Manfred, VA3WK, is giving up his two repeaters (VA3IGS on 147.24 and
VE3KNA on 443.4 MHz). After discussion, the members decided that the club
should take over these repeaters. Hopefully they will be able to remain
at their current location. In view of the change in ownership, this
action will require a notice to Industry Canada and a request for coordination
to the Saint Lawrence Valley Repeater Council.</p>

<p>Rick, with Tom and Harold,
VA3UNK, gave an illustrated talk and demonstration of networking and amateur
radio communication on 2.4 GHz, using 802.11b/g computer networking equipment.</p>

<p>The next meeting will be on May
2, 2006 </p>

<p>Graham Ide VE3BYT Secretary.</p>
