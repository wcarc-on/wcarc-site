<p>Tom, VA3NFA, welcomed
everyone. The guests identified
themselves - Brian, Brian, Brian, Darrell, Andy, and Rick (as noted above).</p>

<p>Ken, VA3KA, was
absent. Accounts are up to date.</p>

<p>Rick, VE3CVG,
indicated that the web site is up to date. </p>

<p>Graham, VE3BYT -
nothing to report. The minutes of the
October meeting are on the web site.</p>

<p>Brad, VE3BSM,
reported that the VE3WCC digipeater needs a reboot, and that VE3PGC in Cornwall
is not functioning.</p>

<p>Beacons:</p>
<p>Kieran's (VA3KS) beacon VA3SJS on 144.290 MHz has good coverage throughout the
area. </p>
<p>Tom is working on a 222 MHz transmitter that will become a beacon, and is
looking for a suitable transmitter for the 430 MHz band that can serve as a
beacon. </p>
<p>Rick, VE3CVG, is working on a pair of 'micro-beacons' of less than one-half
watt output. Soon he will put them on
the air at 28.127 and 50.074 MHz.</p>
<p>Tom would like the club to have beacons on the 1.2 and 2.3 GHz bands as well in
addition to 222 MHz and Kieran's beacon on the 144 MHz band.</p>

<p>Tom discussed the December
meeting. Everyone agreed to follow the
example of last year - a bit of a party with food and door prizes - and the
election of officers. In addition to
the usual officers, the club needs a number of coordinators, such as for
repeaters and beacons, programs, events and so on.</p>
<p>Membership fees are due at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Tom got a positive response to the idea of another tour of the Diefenbunker on
a Tuesday evening early in the new year.</p>

<p>Rick showed his MFJ vertical
antenna, which covers the 144, 430 and 1.2 GHz bands - $125C at Bytown Marine.</p>

<p>Tom brought his low power transmitter
for 222 MHz. The manufacturer is as yet
unidentified. This is destined to
become a beacon.</p>

<p>Graham showed his TX-220B, a 1 -
2-watt transmitter for 222 MHz, from a kit made by VHF Engineering. VHFE used to put out kits for bands from 50
to 450 MHz, plus power amplifiers, and various receiver and repeater
modules. The company ceased
manufacturing quite a few years ago. Where are you, VHFE, now that we really need you?</p>

<p>Al, VO1NO, made an excellent
illustrated presentation of his 1999 DXpedition (IOTA) to Saint Paul Island,
north off the tip of Cape Breton. There
have been around 350 shipwrecks off this island (sounds like a reason not to go
there). Al recounted the early days and
the need for a lighthouse and horn on Saint Paul. Al remembered the 'captain' throwing out the anchor with the rope
unattached to the boat. (This is the
best way to get rid of 'boat anchors' - throw them in the ocean. Another way is to advertise them on
eBay). Apparently all participants had
a great time. The mysteries remain -
what made the scream in the woods when no large mammals live on the island, and
what were the 'ghost lights' seen across the bay?</p>

<p>Al reported that the Field Day
effort placed 4<sup>th</sup> in Canada
in the 2A category - pretty good show.</p>

<p>The net that meets on 3730 kHz
most nights usually has about 20 participating. Details are on the VE3RIX web site.</p>

<p>
The next meeting will be on December 5, 2006 -
food, door prizes, membership dues and the election.</p>


<p>Graham Ide VE3BYT<br>
Secretary.</p>
