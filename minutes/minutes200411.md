title: Minutes - Meeting of November 2, 2004
---
*I trust you all realize that by doing the minutes so promptly, I am depriving myself of
the pleasures of procrastination.*

A good turnout - 16 active members showed up.  There was a lineup
half an hour before the meeting, waiting for Ken to arrive to open the
door - no doubt caused by Ken's warning that seating would be
limited.  So, if you came on time, then you were late.

Manfred VA3MWK showed the progress he had made on his PIC-
based APRS TNC and Display.  Manfred has accommodated in the
software the various types of packets that may be expected.  The unit
is very compact and small, including the 4-line LC display.  There was
considerable discussion about circuit boards, hardware packaging,
etc.  Manfred is continuing his development and will bring us up to
date again at the next meeting.

Doug VE3XK gave an outline of RAC's new amateur insurance,
covering all RAC members.  An excellent initiative!  If you are not now
a member of RAC, this alone would be a good reason to join (apart
from the fact that present members are carrying you on their backs by
supporting RAC in its extensive efforts for ALL Canadian amateurs).
Clubs will be covered by the insurance, but there will likely be extra
costs to a club for any club members who are not RAC members.  No
doubt there will be further information in the next issue of TCA.  An
increase in RAC membership fees is expected in 2005, so joining now
before the end of December would be a good idea.

Tom VA3NFA who had accepted the job of organizing Field Day 2005
activities for the club, asked for helpers to set up and conduct the
event.  He got a number of eager supporters responding.

Officers for 2005 were elected.  While there was much scrambling
among members to offer themselves for the posts, the popular
choices finally settled out to:

* President: Tom Zinck (VA3NFA)
* Vice President / Webmaster: Rick Bandla (VE3CVG)
* Treasurer: Ken Asmus (VA3KA)
* Secretary: Graham Ide (VE3BYT)

There was discussion of reducing membership fees for 2005 for
Current Members.  Decision on this question will be made at the
December meeting.

The 220 repeater apparently needs work done on the duplexer.
Someone will inquire to see if a local person would be willing to check
this out.  It  would be good to have this machine on the air again, to
demonstrate and encourage use of the band and to serve as a radio
meeting place for WCARC members and others.

Graham VE3BYT discovered that nobody had received his report
about checking out the Club beacon on 903.370 MHz (located at
Pinecrest Road and the Queensway).  Graham will send this out
again.

Tom VA3NFA suggested another club beacon project for the 144 or
the 222 MHz band.  It was thought by most that a beacon on 222
would be useful.  This project provides an opportunity for members to
develop the system, including the construction of the controller.

Doug VE3XK reported that he has a problem with feedline for his 222
and 1240 band antennas and can not stuff any more coax through the
conduit.  An overhead run of coax cables was suggested, at good
clearance above ground and gaily bedecked and festooned with
Christmas lights.  Doug will consult with the authorities on this
possible approach to resolving the situation.

Gord VE3PPE brought in a box of stuff from his basement.  One item
with good potential was a Heath Station Monitor/Panadapter which
was offered at auction.  Bidding was lively, with Rick VE3CVG beating
down the competition for the prize.  Gord could not make proper
change, so Rick overpaid and Gord owes Rick $2.00C ($1.66US) at
the next meeting.

Gord also delivered the club's Linx 902 MHz Modules Development
Kit to Rick.

Graham  VE3BYT  
Secretary.
