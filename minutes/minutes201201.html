<!--VicePresident--><STRONG>VicePresident's Report</STRONG><BR>
  Vice President Andrew Hart(VE3NVK) reported that while we still cannot book meeting rooms in advance we have usually been able to
  get the room we want when we need it. He also noted that FUNcube, a small
  satellite created by a team of radio amateurs and other specialists now has a
  launch agreement and is expected to be launched in the third quarter of 2012.
  The satellite will be launched in a circular low earth orbit that is "sun
  scnchronous" to ensure it has the necessary power and will appear at regular
  times for educational outreach activities at schools and colleges. The satellite
  will transmit signals that can be easily received directly using a simple and
  inexpensive "ground station" enclosed in a USB dongle. The spacecraft will also
  provide a U/V linear transponder for radio amateurs during local "night",
  weekends and holiday periods. Additional information can be found on the <a href="http://www.uk.amsat.org/3239">AMSAT-UK website</a>.<BR><BR><BR><!--VicePresidentEnd--><STRONG>Old

  Harold (VE3UNK) noted that the 46th Canadian Ski Marathon will take place
  11-12 February. Shortly after it began amateur radio operators undertook to
  provide thecommunications  essential for the operation of the marathon and
  safety of its participants. Typical duties consist of providing communications
  from check points along the route and there are still spaces available for
  operators. He encouraged any licenced amateur to consider participating - it is
  a fulfilling and memorable experience. Equipment is available (2 m mobile
  radios) for any operator who does not have his or her own. For more information
