  <br><!--Secretary--><strong>Secretary's Report:</strong> <br>
  Secretary

  <br><br><br><!--SecretaryEnd--><!--Treasurer--><strong>Treasurer's
    Report:</strong> <br>
  Treasurer Ken Asmus (VA3KA) reported that the financial situation had not changed significantly since the last meeting. The clubnow has 23 full time members and 3 life members. At present the club has about $650 in the bank and the one large pending expenditure is the renwall of our insurance through Radio Amateurs of Canada.<br><br><br><!--VicePresidentEnd--><strong>Old

  <strong>General Reports:</strong>
  <br><br>
  <strong>Beacons</strong><br>
  Doug Leach (VE3XK) reported that the WCARC beacons at 2m, 1.25m and 70cm continue to operate
  nominally. Some members asked about the possibility of a beacon at 1296MHz recognizing the growing interest in that band. Doug noted that there would be space for a
fourth beacon in the present beacon hardware. The club has not had the financial resources to consider a fourth beacon. He suggested it might be worth checking with other clubs to ase if their was interest in sharing the costs.
No decision was take but some members will likely continue to investigate possibilities.<br><br>
  <strong>24GHz</strong><br>
  Bert (VE2ZAZ) reported that the 2 transceivers he had demonstrated at the May meeting worked well at the Grid Expedition in mid June.<br><br>
<strong>VE3WCC APRS Digipeater</strong><br>
Ken Asmus (VA3KA) reported that work was underway to resolve  problems with the digipeater described at the June meeting. Brad (VE3BSM) is working on the issue and it appears the TNC is the likely problem. Ken has provided
a replacement TNC and that should be installed soon.<br><br>
<br>
  <strong>77GHz </strong><br>
  Glenn (VE3XRA) reported on a meeting he had attended with representatives of Bosch from Germany concerning their desire to use spectrum around 77GHz for short range
automotive radar. At present in North America amateur and radio radio astronomy are primary users in this band.  Automakers would like to introduce collision avoidance
radars in vehicles in the next few years and some governments are considering making such systems manditory for certain vehicles initially such as heavy trucks. Automotive
radar systems in Europe at present operate at 24GHz - some high end vehicles by BMW and Mercedes use short range radar for &quot;adaptive cruise control&quot; automatically
adjusting speed when other vehicles are close. Automotive radar must vacate the 24GHz spectrum in Europe by 2015. In Europe, regulatory authorities worked a swap to give radio
amateurs a slighlty lower band, freeing up the desired spectrum.  Bosch has had preliminary meetings with the US Administration and ARRL and provided the briefing to RAC
representatives following a meeting with Industry Canada. The presentation was factual focusing on the radar systems and what was being done in other administrations.
Bosch has not made a specific proposal to Canada yet.<br><br>
<strong>D-STAR
</strong><br>Ken (VA3KA) reported on efforts to solve the recurring problems with internet connections for the downtown Ottawa D-Star repeater. It now appears that throttling
back of data flow by the internet provider is the main cause of the problems. A new internet provider will be tried. The Almonte repeater continues to function well.
<br><br>
  <strong>Presentation</strong><br>
Al Penney (VO1NO) reported on the expedition to FN04xa for the June ARRL VHF QSO party. WCARC compiled its largest ever score this year, more than twice the highest achieved
in earlier years. His presentation is posted on the club website.
  <br><br>
  <strong>Adjournment</strong> <br>
  The President stated
  that there being no further business, the meeting would be adjourned. The
  meeting was closed at 21:45 hours.
