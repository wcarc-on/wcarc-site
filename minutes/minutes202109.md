### Vice President's Report
- Mike (VE3MKX) reported via email: He has moved out of the Ottawa area. He does not currently have high speed internet, so it is not possible for him to attend the meeting. He has advised the board that he would resign from the Vice President position at the end of the year.  
- In response to Mike's plan to resign as Vice President:
  - Charles (VA3CPY) announced that the Officers election to be held in December will also include the Vice President's position.
  - Bert (VE2ZAZ) mentioned that a few members can fill in with presentations when told ahead of time, if Mike cannot book one in time.

### Director's Report
- Nothing to report.

### President's Report
- AC wiring cost for beacon relocation was received from the DARC folks. This topic is addressed in the old business section.

### Speaker
Wayne (VE3CZO) had an impromptu quiz: He showed a 5.8 GHz feedpoint made by Peter VA3PJ. Wayne made measurements and the feedpoint is a good performer on that band.

### Old Business
- VHF/UHF Beacon move:
  - Charles (VA3CPY) has received an update from the DARC on cost of feeding an uninterruptible AC supply to the beacons by a licensed electrician. It is $1,685 plus tax. Other option would be to chose solar or wind power. Third option would be to find another location for the beacons. We will need to keep the discussion going and investigate further.
  - Charles will ask the DARC for a forecast of the additional hardware that may be required at the Diefenbunker site.
  - Bert (VE2ZAZ) will contact Rick (VE3CVG) about the possibility of using the YMCA site for the beacons.
  - Wayne (VE3CZO) will check with Harrie (VE3HYS) of the OARC regarding using Camp Fortune site.

### New Business
None.

- Clayton (VE3IRR) attended the ARRL & TAPR Digital Communications Conference. He found it very interesting.
- Clayton (VE3IRR) also mentioned about the GNU Radio Conference happening this week (20-24 September). There is no cost for attending. If you are interested in digital radio, it is a conference not to miss.
