<p><strong>Reports / Project Updates<br>
  <br>
</strong><strong>Beacons</strong><br>
Doug Leach reported that the beacons had been taken down and moved but not yet installed. Some repairs will be completed before installation including replacement of transistors in the 6m beacon. They have been ordered. Plans called for installation  after the June VHF contest at Richard Ferch&rsquo;s QTH (FN25ce)</p>
<p><strong>Broadband Hamnet</strong><br>
Bert Zauhar (VE2ZAZ) reported that Rick Bandla (VE3CVG) and Dave Harris (VE3KMV) pointed the main downtown 2.4GHz antenna   in his direction  to try that path.&nbsp; The link was up and down but not as solid as the link to Clayton&rsquo;s QTH although the  path lenght to his QTH is only about 1 km Longer.&nbsp; The experimenters believe the weaker than expected link is likely the result of more foliage along that path. The 5.8GHz  link from downtown to Clayton's qth continues to be solid and benefits from less background noise that the 2.4GHz link.</p>
<p><strong>Announcements / Show and Tell</strong><br>
Clayton Smith showed software he is developing to make Hack RF work as a ham transceiver. He showed members the Gnu Radio Companion flow-graphs to implement CW receive and transmit on the Hack RF and noted that he had stitched them  together with Python code and implemented a TR switch. He planned to use the software during the VHF contest. Several members who have HackRF devices will bring them to the contest..</p>

Doug Leach led members through a planning session in preparation for the June VHF contest.<br>
