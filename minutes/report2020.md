*The following was added by the Vice President at the meeting:*

- Meeting via video platforms initially proved to be challenging, but we have managed to adapt the meeting flow and presentations to a more suitable format for remote meetings.

*The following was added by the Secretary after the meeting:*

The Club's 6m, 2m, 1.25m and 70cm beacons continued to operate from the Boltwood home in Stittsville. The 70cm beacon was taken off the air for a couple of months due to a defective RF connector. Robert (VE3BE) fixed the issue and returned the beacon to full operation.
