<strong>New Business:</strong> <br>Possible sale of  WCARC 2m and 70cm repeaters to the Almonte Amateur radio Club:<br>The meeting considered a proposal from the Almone Club to purchase WCARC repeaters that had been removed from the site at the request of the new site owner. WCARC has been unable to find an acceptable site for them. Barney, VA3BGB, moved, seconded by Greg, VA3OMP, that the club accept the offer of $500 for the 2m and 70cm repeaters and their associated equipment. In the ensuing discussion it was proposed that the President discuss the proposed sale with Manfred, VA3WK, who had originally donated the repeaters. It was agreed that the club could consider the motion to sell the repeaters and would reconsider the decision at the following meeting if Manfred had significant concerns. If the motion was approved and the subsequent discussion with Manfred did not reveal concerns, the sale could take place without delay. On this basis the club considered the motion proposed by VA3BGB and seconded by VA3OMP. The motion to sell the repeaters was approved.
