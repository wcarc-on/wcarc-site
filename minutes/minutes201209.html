  <strong>Opening:</strong><br>
  The meeting was opened by President Al Penney (VO1NO) at 19:30 hours. <br>

  <br><!--Secretary--><strong>Secretary's Report:</strong> <br>
  Secretary
  Glenn MacDonell (VE3XRA), introduced the minutes of the previous meeting, thanking Bert (VE2ZAZ) for taking notes in his absence, Al (VO1NO) for transmitting the notes and the Webmaster, Rick (VE3CVG), for corrections. Members noted the need for two more corrections to the previously posted minutes: Peter (VA3PJ) had attended the meeting but was not shown as present; and the callsign for Dave Goodwin was correct in the main body of the minutes (VE3AAQ) but had a typo in the table listing people present. <br>
  Moved by Bert (VE2ZAZ) that the  minutes, as corrected, be approved. Seconded by Graham Ide (VE3BYT). <br>Motion approved.
  <br><br><br><!--SecretaryEnd--><!--Treasurer--><strong>Treasurer's
    Report:</strong> <br>
  In the absence of the Treasurer, the President, Al (VO1NO) reported that the financial situation had not changed significantly since the last meeting.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>President's
    Report:</strong> <br>
  The President reported that he had been contacted by Martin J. Bollinger of the US Naval Institute and the author of <a href="http://www.usni.org/store/books/ebook-editions/warriors-and-wizards">Warriors and Wizards - The Development and Defeat of Radio-Controlled Glide Bombs of the Third Reich</a>. Mr. Bollinger had seen a copy of the presentation that Al gave at the January 2009 WCARC meeting  <a href="../presentations/chase_me_charlies_by_vo1no_minimizer.pdf">Defeating Hitler's Chase Me Charlies</a> that is available on our website. Mr Bollinger found Al's information very useful and commented that he'd have to revise one of his chapters as a result of what he had learned from Al!

  <strong>General Report and Announcements:</strong><br>
  <br>
  <strong>Beacons</strong><br>
  Doug Leach (VE3XK) reported that the WCARC beacons (6m, 2m, 1.25m, 70cm) continue to operate with no problems. Rick Bandla (VE3CVG) reported that he planned to rebuild the power supply for the 900MHz beacon that was temporarily installed at his QTH.  There was a brief discussion on the possibility of adding a 1296MHz beacon to the existing beacon group. Doug Leach (VE3XK) noted that there was space for an additional beacon. However the club would need to find additional financial resources if members wanted to add a module.<br><br>
  <strong>Grid Expedition</strong><br>
  Members noted that the latest edition of The Canadian Amateur included the report on the expedition to FN04xa that had been submitted by the President, Al (VO1NO).</p>
<p><strong>D-STAR<br>
</strong>Rick Bandla (VE3CVG) noted that the problems affecting the internet connection for the Ottawa D-STAR repeater (VA3ODG) had been identified and corrected - it is now working well and Ying (VA3YH) and Rick are continuing software cleanup.  Several people were exploring the use of the small and inexpensive ($35 each) <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/faqs">Raspberry Pi </a>credit card sized computer for hot spots and D-STAR repeaters. </p>
<p><strong>Ottawa Hamfest</strong><br>
Rick Bandla (VE3CVG) reminded members that WCARC will have a table at the Hamfest, that takes place as usual, in Carp on the Saturday following the September meeting (Sept 8). Tom (VA3NFA) is cleaning out his shack and has provided equipment to be sold at the WCARC table, with the proceeds to the club.</p>
<p>
<p><strong>Presentations</strong> <br>
  In lieu of a formal presentation, members engaged in a spirited exchange of information on their recent amateur radio adventures and misadventures.
