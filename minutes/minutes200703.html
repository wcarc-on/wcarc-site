<p>Tom, VA3NFA, led introductions
around the room.</p>

<p>Rick, VE3CVG, mentioned several
upcoming events - The Iroquois FleaMarket, the Sprint in April, and the
Brampton Hamfest.</p>

<p>Rick has updated the web site and
added to personal pages. Presentations
made at meetings will be on the WCARC web site.</p>

<p>The 903 MHz beacon is working,
and has been received on a short mobile antenna at VE3BYT in Bells Corners in
the west end.</p>

<p>Brad, VE3BSM, reported re APRS
that the VE3DVQ site needed a software reset. Seems OK now.</p>

<p>Graham, VE3BYT, reported that the
minutes of previous meetings are on the web site.</p>

<p>Rick showed Kent Brittain's
(WA5VJB) neat PCB antennas for the higher bands - Yagis, Big Wheels, and Log
Periodics. Members can Email Tom or
Rick to indicate their interest in ordering some of these antennas.</p>

<p>Rick and Doug, VE3XK, gave a
dissertation and demonstration of Tellurometers on the 10 GHz band. Dr. T.L. Wadley in South Africa invented the
Tellurometer in 1957 as a survey instrument. It was the first survey instrument using microwaves. It runs 20 to 50 milliwatts with a bandwidth
of 100kHz, with an ERP of about 12 watts with the integral parabolic dish
antenna. A range of about 100 KM is
possible, full duplex.</p>

<p>Members can contact Ray, VE3FN,
or Ralph, VE3BBM, if they are interested in possibly acquiring an instrument or
two.</p>

<p>The next meeting will be on April 3, 2007.</p>

<p>Graham Ide VE3BYT<br>
Secretary.</p>
