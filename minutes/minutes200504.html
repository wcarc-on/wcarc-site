<p>Many thanks go to Barney (VA3BGB) for providing a pleasant location for the meeting.</p>

<p>Most meetings are informal, and this one was a level down from there. Our Treasurer was away, and our VP was not up to scratch</p>

<p>Rick, VE3CVG, had sent a message that the 902 MHz transverters were to be shipped from DEMI on April 18.</p>

<p>Graham brought the only 'show and tell' item for the evening, a product woven from fine copper that might serve some purposes in radio applications, possibly for grounds or for shielding.  Someone suggested it would be good as chain mail for action figures, like Barbie.</p>

<p>We enjoyed a good chat on a wide range of subjects, mostly related to Tom's plans to be a rover station on VHF and UHF bands this summer.  These included antenna design selections and polarization for each band, approaches to antenna mounts and masts, and cabling and equipment power in the vehicle.</p>

<p>There was preliminary discussion of potential alternative sites for monthly meetings, such as at a restaurant with a meal, or perhaps at the Diefenbunker in conjunction with donating work on the ham station and the antennas.  The thought was advanced that this location might become available for the 222 MHz FM repeater and the club beacons.</p>

<p>The meeting adjourned at about 2115hrs.</p>

<p>And, at the request of the President, the following notice:
