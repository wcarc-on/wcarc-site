This looked like a record turnout
in the recent history of the club.

As each of us arrived on scene, we picked a number to set our turn for choosing
a prize from among all the goodies on the table.

President Tom, VA3NFA, indicated
the agenda for the evening: the year in
review, notes on the constitution, election of officers, new business, and
prizes and refreshments.

Ken, VA3KA, reported that the
finances are in solid shape, with membership dues coming in for the new
year. All bills are paid. Also, the club has its largest membership
for some years. Ken will present a
complete picture in January.

Rick, VE3CVG, reported that the
WCARC web site now includes a list of members with their Maidenhead Grid
locations.

Graham, VE3BYT, noted that the
minutes for the November meeting are up on the web site.

Tom, in looking over the past
year, reminded everyone that:

* Membership is at a high level.
* We have a good web site, thanks to Rick, VE3CVG.
* We have a good turnout for VHF contests.
* Field Day 2006 was a great success, largely thanks to Al, VO1NO.
* APRS and packet installations are working well, thanks to Brad, VE3BSM.
* The club has a series of VHF/UHF beacons on the air or in preparation.
* The club has 144 and 440 MHz repeaters, donated by Manfred, VA3WK.
* We have had some interesting technical and other presentations, and will continue this effort into 2007.

Dale, VE3XZT, reported that the
Hamtronics controller on the 2 Metre repeater went out and needs a new PROM
programmed.

Tom stated that the WCARC was
incorporated in Ontario in 1980 as a not-for-profit corporation. We need, but do not have, a copy of the
constitution. It will be reviewed for
continuing appropriateness when we can obtain a copy. Probably at that time we can count on a review committee headed
by Brian, VE3UU.

Election of Officers: The current officers were voted back into
office for another term, there being no other candidates demanding to be
nominated.

* President: Tom, VA3NFA. Nominated by VO1NO, seconded by VE3BSM.
* Vice President, Rick, VE3CVG. Nominated by VE3XK, seconded by VE3IAO.
* Treasurer, Ken, VA3KA. Nominated by VE3CVG, seconded by VA3NFA.
* Secretary, Graham, VE3BYT. Nominated by VO1NO, seconded by VA3NFA.

It was generally agreed that to
keep club activities functioning smoothly, certain Committee Chairpersons and
Coordinators need to be appointed. The
first of these are:

* Dale, VE3XZT, Chairman, Repeaters and Beacons.
* Al, VO1NO, Chairman, Presentations and Programs.
* Brad, VE3BSM, Chairman, APRS and Packet Facilities.

Appointment of the above-noted
Chairmen/Coordinators was approved on a motion by Tom, VA3NFA, seconded by
Steve, VA3SAX.

Other committees will be
designated as and when required, including a committee to review and make
recommendations on the constitution and by-laws.

President Tom, VA3NFA, is keen to
implement club beacons on the 222 and 432 MHz bands. To this end, the club approved an expenditure of up to $250 to
purchase equipment for the 432 band beacon. One possibility is a transverter available from Rick, VE3CVG, driven by
an HTX-100 or some such 10 Metre transceiver or transmitter. Tom will consider this equipment and other
alternatives and decide on what he wants to do.

There being no further business,
the meeting adjourned to the choosing of prizes by members in turn, much
merriment and refreshments. Refreshments were dealt with while ragchewing - a very neat trick that
everyone managed quite well. A very
pleasant time was had by all.

Thanks to Rick and other
contributors for gathering the prizes and to Tom for bringing the refreshments.

The next meeting will be on January 2, 2007.

Graham Ide VE3BYT  
Secretary.
