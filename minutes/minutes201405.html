Glenn (VE3XRA) reported that Industry Canada made two announcements with implications for amateur radio on May 1:
<br>1 - Canadian radio amateurs now have a new band at 630m or 472-479 KHz
<br>
<br>2 - Industry Canada published comments that it had received, including one from Radio Amateurs of Canada (RAC), on proposed changes to its antenna siting document.
Industry Canda proposed removing the exemption from consultation for antennas only for broadcasting and cellular antenna structures. Industry Canada did not announce
its final decision on the proposed changes.
<br><br>
Rick (VE3CVG) showed us a self-contained 5.8GHz dish and radio made by Ubiquity. It may be used for point-to-point data communication and will operate in the ISM band
or as a ham radio device. Ubiquity also makes a version called the Nanobridge M2 which operates at 2.4GHz. Both units will be useful for the mesh network when the
firmware is finished, along with specific models of the WRT54Gx family.
<br><br>
<STRONG>Presentations</STRONG> <BR>
Doug Leach (VE3XK) gave us a comprehensive presentation on WCARC Plans for the 2014 June VHF Contest. He described the facilities of the new location and
led a discussion that resulted in a series of decisions on equipment to be used for 50 MHz through 1296 MHz. Important information related to
WCARC participation in the contest may be viewed here:
