<br><br><!--TreasurerEnd--><strong>Old Business:</strong>
<br>None
<br><br><strong>New Business:</strong> <br>None
<br><br><strong>General Reports:</strong>
<br><br><strong>Beacons</strong>
<br>The Beacons have been off the air for a few weeks after a power failure on the local grid because the 3 members who usually reset them after such a failure have all been out of the country. This will be resolved shortly.<br><br><strong>DSTAR</strong><br>Ken(VA3KA) reported that VE3EFF's hot spot in Stittsville is now on the air. Work to improve internet access at the YMCA, site of the repeater, continues.<br><br><strong>Grid Expedition</strong><br>Al(VO1NO) reminded the meeting that WCARC will undertake its annual expedition to FN04xa for the ARRL June VHF QSO party on June 11-12 2011 and again operate from a site near overlooking Lake Ontario. Last year a shortage of operators and poor propagation limited our score and we dropped from highest score in Canada 2009 to #2 in 2010. We plan to regain top spot this year. Most participants will travel the approximately 3 hours to the site near Grafton Ontario on Friday June 10 to begin set up and return home Monday June 13. However anyone wishing to help with operations for part of the weekend is welcome to participate.<br><br><strong>FUNcube Dongle</strong><br>Andy(VE3NVK) described and showed the meeting the FUNcube dongle he had recently acquired. It is a software defined radio receiver operating from 64MHz to 1.7 GHz the size of a USB memory stick. More information is avaialable at <a href="http://www.funcubedongle.com/">http://www.funcubedongle.com/</a>.

<br><br><strong>Measuring Oscillator Stability</strong><br>Bert(VE2ZAZ) briefly described work he was doing to assess the stability of several of his oscillators using Spectrum Lab, a free WinXP spectrum analyzer program (information and download from <a href="http://www.qsl.net/dl4yhf/spectra1.html/">http://www.qsl.net/dl4yhf/spectra1.html/</a>. Bert has been able to achieve very high accuracy with a simple setup. As a result of interest from members he will do a presentation on his work at a future meeting.

<br><br><strong>Islands on the Air (IOTA)</strong><br>Al(VO1NO) noted that he planned to participate in a DXpedition to activate Bon Portage Island on the southern tip of Nova Scotia 30-31 July 2011.

<br><br><strong>Presentation(s)/Activity:</strong>
<br>Jeff Milne(VE3EFF) demonstrated the use of "Radio Mobile", freeware developed by VE2DBE, to predict the performance of a radio system. It uses digital terrain elevation data for automatic extraction of a path profile between a transmitter and receiver and uses this profile along with system, environmental and statistical parameters in a radio propagation model. Jeff has been using the system to great effect to understand propagation of D-STAR signals from the downtown Ottawa repeater at 2m, 70cm and 23cm. He showed where reception was difficult and how the hot spots currently being deployed will improve coverage.

<br><br><strong>Adjournment:</strong> <br>The President Al Penney(VO1NO) stated that there being no further business, the meeting would be adjourned. The meeting was closed at 21:30 hours.
