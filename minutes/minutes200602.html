<P>Tom, VA3NFA, called the meeting to order at around 7:30, and asked if there
was any new business.</P>
<P>Rick, VE3CVG, reported that the 903 MHz beacon is up again, thanks to Phil,
VE3CIQ. It is located at NRC on Montreal Road, a good high site.
Strong signals are being received at VE3XK and VA3KA. Graham, VE3BYT, can
hear it with a 2 Meter whip antenna inside his house that is mostly shielded
from RF.</P>
<P>There was some discussion about putting up a 902 band repeater. It was
agreed that such a project would depend on a good source of reasonably-priced
equipment becoming available. Suitable gear may be available at Dayton or
Rochester.</P>
<P>Graham proposed that the club refurbish and reinstall the 222 band repeater
as there are a number of members who have FM equipment for this band.
Manfred, VA3WK, has not been successful in getting the duplexer to tune
properly, so Graham suggested that the 222 repeater could be built with a split
site, linked on 445 MHz. Phil suggested that the club speak to Sean,
VE3HXP, who might assist.</P>
<P>Manfred noted that there is little activity on his 144 and 440 band
repeaters.</P>
<P>Rick proposed that the club should put up beacons on the 1240 and 430 MHz
bands, and perhaps 222 as well.</P>
<P>Ken, VA3KA, reported on finances and stated that the club has 24 members at
present. Ken reported too that AMSAT is looking for money to build Eagle
by 2009, a replacement for AO-40.</P>
<P>Brad, VE3BSM, reported that the digipeaters are working well, although the
signal from Lavant is not so good NW of Almonte and needs to be
investigated. There is a posibility of putting a digi on Camp Fortune in
conjunction with the OARC.</P>
<P>Al, VO1NO, will coordinate the Field Day effort in conjunction with the West
Lanark/Leeds ARES Group. Dale, VE3XZT, will assist, and others will donate
equipment. Proposed is a 2A class installation with two HF stations.
Barry, VE3BSB, has a satellite station. Tom offered his 15 watt solar
panel. There will be a JOTA station, and three demonstration modes - APRS,
ATV and SSTV. The site will be somewhere between West Carleton and
Perth.</P>
<P>Tom is planning Rover activity for the June 11 weekend. He will be on
all VHF and UHF bands to 2.4 GHz, in 8 or 9 grids. Tom will be on 6 AND 2
M while mobile.</P>
<P>Doug, VE3XK, gave a comprehensive and well-received talk on the basics of
APRS and the equipment required, and an outline of the APRS enhancements such as
messaging, weather stations and warnings, and I-Gates.</P>
<P>The next meeting will be on March 7, 2006 </P>

<P>Graham Ide VE3BYT Secretary.</P>
