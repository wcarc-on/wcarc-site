<strong>Old Business:</strong> <br>None<br><br><br>
<strong>New Business:</strong> <br> <b>Data Projector</b><br>As noted at the previous meeting, the club needs to acquire a data projector by the end of the calendar year as the projector it has been using will no longer be available. Future Shop has an acceptable projector on sale but temprorily out of stock. Because the cost is greater than $300, notice must be given a month before a motion to authorize the expenditure. Glenn VE3XRA agreed to pick up a projector if one became available and hold it. pending approval at the next meeting. It can be returned if approval is not given. Moved by VE3XRA, seconded by VA3PJ that notice be given of a motion to authorize an expenditure of up to $450. for the purchase of a data processor. The motion carried.<br><br>

<b>Gift to owner of the site used for the annual Grid Expedition</b><br>On a vacation trip earlier in the summer Barney VE3BGB had purchased a set of Russian pins that would make an ideal Thank-You gift to the owner of the site used for the WCARC annual grid expeditions. The club has been allowed to use the site free of charge for the past 3 June ARRL contests. VE3BGB is willing to provide the set to the club for a later presentation to the site owner. Moved by Andy VE3NVK seconded by Graham VE3BYT that the club reimburse VE3BGB $35 for the Russian pins and that they be given by the club to the owner of the site, used for the June Grid Expeditions. The motion carried.<br><br>
