<br><br>
 <strong>New Business:</strong><br>
Ken Asmus (VA3KA) outlined the history the Club's call sign VE3DVQ for the digipeater providing APRS coverage in the Levant area.
WCARC contributed to that system, when it started 15 years ago. The most recent holder of the call sign, a former WCARC member,
is now a Silent Key. While there are volunteers in the area who can maintain the repeater, they would prefer that the call sign
be held by a member or an Officer of WCARC. It was moved by Doug (VE3XK) that the call signs VE3DVQ and VE3WCC be transferred to
the present President, Clayton (VE3IRR). The motion was seconded by Peter (VA3PJ) and Carried.

been possible to remove them and investigate the fault yet. He was also exploring

early stage in modifications.

best of the considered alternatives. It was Moved by Doug Leach (VE3XK) that we apply to use the Corkery Community Centre and approve the expenditure of $110 for the weekend of June 14-15. Seconded by Glenn (VE3XRA). Carried.
