  General Report and Announcements:</strong><br>
  <br>
  <strong>Beacons</strong><br>
  Doug Leach (VE3XK) reported reported that he was investigating options for other locations that might offer greater elevation and easier access. The
WCARC beacons (6m, 2m, 1.25m, 70cm) continue to operate nominally and there was no urgent requirement to move but if a more desirable location became
available he would advise the club. He also noted that Rick Bandla (VE3CVG) was making good progress in assembling beacons for 903.360MHz and 1296.060MHz, that
will be installed at a central location in Ottawa.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Grid Expedition</strong>:<br>
Al (VO1NO) reminded members of the planned Grid Expedition to FN04xa for the mid-June VHF QSO party. Over each of the past 3 years, the club has added a new microwave band to its capabilitiess (5.8GHz in 2010, 2.4GHz in 2011 and 24GHz last year). Members discussed the possibility of adding another frequency this year. Glenn (VE3XRA) agreed to apprise the next meeting of possible transverters for 3.4GHz.<br>
<br>
<strong>Canadian Ski Marathon</strong><br>
Harold (VA3UNK) reported that the next marathon would take place on 9-10 February 2013. This will be the 40th year that radio amateurs have provided communications for the event.  Radio amateurs play an essential role in the operation of the marathon providing the communications necessary for the safety of skiers and volunteers and the effective management of the complex event. Harold invited any radio amateur interested to contact him and pointed out that operators are really needed - radios are available.</p>
