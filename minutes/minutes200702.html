<p>There was some discussion of web
hosting of the WCARC web site other than on the RAC server. To simplify maintenance, RAC prefers to
purge its server of material from other organizations. Tom, Rick and others will look at options
and will share solutions with the SLVRC.</p>

<p>Field Day will be the 4<sup>th</sup>
weekend in June. Al, VO1NO, will
organize the club's effort as he did last year. We can consider the same site, or the Diefenbunker at Carp.</p>

<p>Rick, VE3CVG, gave a presentation
on the OARDG and DStar. DStar permits
digital voice and data. The mobile
range tends to be less than with conventional FM communication. Rick outlined the various models of
equipment available, currently only from ICOM. The OARDG was formed to implement DStar with the assistance of a New
Horizons Grant. The development team
consists of interested local amateurs.</p>

<p>DStar frequencies proposed are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>145.530, -600 in</li>
  <li>433.050, +5MHz in</li>
  <li>1282.0, -12MHz in: Voice and low speed data</li>
  <li>1299.2 Simplex: High speed data</li>
</ul>

<p> Proposed simplex calling frequencies</p>
<ul>
  <li>145.670</li>
  <li>445.800</li>
  <li>1298.0</li>
</ul>

<p>Equipment has been ordered. A site is needed, and a technical writer.</p>

<p>Manfred, VA3WK, suggested that the WCARC take on work and financial support for
the DStar project. This will be considered
at the next meeting. Other area clubs
may be interested in providing some support.</p>

<p>Dave Goodwin, VE3AAQ, Regional
Director of RAC gave an outline of some current issues at RAC. Rac is looking at a foundation, entry level
class license, with no age limit but with a three year time limit and a limit
on permitted power levels. More details
will be on the RAC web site soon.</p>

<p>Tom, VA3NFA, and Dave, VE3AAQ,
gave a very successful demonstration of Laser communication, using units
available from Ramsey Electronics.</p>

<p>The next meeting will be on March
6, 2007.</p>

<p>Graham Ide VE3BYT<br>
Secretary.</p>
