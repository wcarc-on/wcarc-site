<p>Rick, VE3CVG, VP and Webmaster,
was unable to join us. Ken, VA3KA,
Treasurer, was away on business. The
finances are reported to be in good shape, as usual.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Graham, VE3BYT, reported
that minutes of previous meetings are completed up to date and have been sent
to Rick for posting on the web site.</p>

<p>Tom, VA3NFA, having acquired a
box of VHF Engineering transmitter strips, amplifiers and receiver modules,
passed the treasures along to Doug, VE3XK, who will package the club beacons
with their controller/identifier for relocation to VO1NO near
Merrickville. The club will eventually
have a suite of beacons on the 50, 144, 222, 430 and 902 (and perhaps 1240) MHz
bands, thus offering a service to all of hamanity, or at least amateurs in the
region. Currently, club beacons are
operating on the 440 and 903 bands, with a beacon on 2 Meters at VA3KS. Dean's, VA3CDD, spectrum analyser will be of
considerable assistance in setting these up.</p>

<p>The possibility of a DXpedition
during the June 2008 VHF/UHF QSO Party was discussed. Some thought had been given to operating near Algonquin Park in
FN05. However, this would not be a
great location for bands other than 6 Meters with a possible band opening. Alternatively, there is a site near Cobourg
where there is a junction of FN03, 04, 13 and 14, and the altitude is about 120
Metres above Lake Ontario. Doug has
made preliminary inquiries with a property owner in the area for use of their
site. It was agreed that the club would
write to confirm their permission for the attack on the bands from that
location.</p>

<p>Barry, VE3BSB, has written
requesting support for tracking a balloon launch from the Perth area probably
on November 24<sup>th</sup>. All agreed
that we would show support for the project.</p>

<p>Graham mentioned that Ramsey
Electronics has a neat little 300 mW 2 Meter transmitter kit available that
might be suitable for a balloon or rocket project. This design uses many of those cute little surface-mount parts. The kit is $45, and built it's $80. Graham
mused that he might buy a transmitter kit and put it on the shelf along with
his unfinished 222 and 902 MHz transverters that also use surface-mount parts.</p>

<p>Graham outlined again a proposal
for a comprehensive club project that might involve a majority of the members,
an example being a high-altitude balloon launch. A preliminary description of such a project was presented at the
October meeting (this was attached to the October minutes). This type of club project will be further
considered in the new year. Possibilities also include a Software Defined Radio and a Rocket Launch
with telemetry.</p>

<p>Doug showed his equipment for
attaching connectors on coaxial cable and gave a description of crimping
(rather than soldering). Palladin, who
make a crimper for PowerPole connectors as well, manufactures the crimper and
cutters for various common sizes of cable. These are available from HamSource.com in Bridgeport CT (John Kalotai,
N1OLO). The club will consider
purchasing crimping equipment for loan to members, along with a supply of
connectors for purchase.</p>

<p>The next meeting will our
December Election, Celebration and Snack Party with club and donated prizes, on
December 4, 2007. Nominations are needed for the club Executive positions of
President, Vice-President and Secretary, and perhaps a new Director position
(meeting planner/project coordinator?).</p>

<p>Graham Ide VE3BYT&nbsp;<br>
Secretary.</p>
