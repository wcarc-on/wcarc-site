  <BR>
  <strong>Grid Expedition</strong>:<br>
Al (VO1NO) gave an overview of preparations for the Grid Expedition to FN04xa for the ARRL June VHF QSO Party. . He welcomed Richard Ferch VE3KI who had recently agreed to participate. He will give a full report on the event at the July meeting.</p>
<p><strong>2304 MHz Transverter Project</strong><br>
  Bert (VE2ZAZ) reported on his conversion of  a transmitter-receiver pair previously used by Rogers Communications for point to point communications at 2.4 GHZ. Jimmy VE2JWH had been given several units when Rogers took them out of service and had piloted a conversion allowing their use at 2304MHz. Bert was one of a number of Quebec hams who had modified units they obtained and he showed members the results of his work. The converted transverter uses a 2m IF,  provides an output of 1.3 w at 2304 MHz and operates from a 12v DC supply. He noted that approximately $150 worth of parts need to be purchased or found in members spare parts caches to modify the devices. VE2JWH still had additional units and was willing to make them available to interested club members through Bert. Six members indicated there interest and Bert agreed to transmit the request to VE2JWH. He also agreed to organize purchase of needed components. He asked members to confirm their interest by email to him and noted that that this would likely be a club activity in the fall given members' committments over the summer.</p>
