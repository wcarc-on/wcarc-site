<!--Treasurer--><STRONG>Treasurer's Report:</STRONG> <BR>The Treasurer was in Resolute Bay and so unable to attend the meeting. He prepared a report that was presented by the President, Al Penney(VO1NO). Current membership consists of 31 paid up members as well as 3 life members. Our RAC insurance for 2010 has been renewed (cost $56.64 - pro rated as there are only 5 months left in the year). This year the cost for RAC insurance has changed and the club pays an additional fee for members who are not RAC members. The increased cost is $11/year. Our RAC  affiliation was also renewed (cost $28.25). After these transactions as well as receiving $500 for the sale of repeaters to the Almonte Amateur Radio Club and providing $200 to defray expenses of the Grid expedition the club's current bank balance is $1091. <!--TreasurerEnd--><BR><BR>
<STRONG>Old Business:</STRONG>
<BR>The President reported that he had discussed the sale of WCARC repeaters to the Almonte Amateur radio Club. Manfred had no concerns with the sale and was happy the the repeaters would be put into service. Consequently the sale proceeded as approved at the previous meeting.<BR><BR>
<STRONG>New Business:</STRONG> <BR>WCARC will have a table at the OARC hamfest.<BR><BR>
<STRONG>General Reports:</STRONG> <BR>Beacons:<BR>The slight problem with the beacon identifier (the final character is omitted every second transmission) was again discussed briefly. The problem persists. It was not felt to be too serious and possible methods of correcting it (alternatives to sending equipment back to the manufacturer) were proposed. No decisions were taken.<BR>The possibility of adding an additional beacon for 1296GHz was raised and will be considered next year.<BR><BR>Website:<BR>The Webmaster, Rick (VE3CVG) reported on further developments with the registration of the domaine previously used for the WCARC website. There are new avenues to explore to bring the domaine under control of the club but nothing has been settled yet and this topic will likely come up again at future meetings.<BR><BR>
Projector:<BR>
The Vice-President noted that the club had been using the projector owned by the Ottawa chapter of the QCWC.
This will not be possible in the coming year and so the club will need to find another projector.  Glenn(VE3XRA)
agreed to check on possible solutions and report back to a future meeting. <BR><BR>
<STRONG>Presentation(s)/Activity:</STRONG>
<BR><BR>Rick (VE3CVG) reported on the work undertaken to improve the D-STAR repeater system. A new server has been installed and more secure internet access obtained.
<BR><BR>Glenn (VE3XRA) delivered a presentation on Radio Astronomy and Amateur Radio. The presentation is posted on the WCARC website.<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Adjournment:</STRONG> <BR>The President Al Penney(VO1NO) stated that there being no further business, the meeting would be adjourned. The meeting was closed at 21:15 hours.
