He has also developed a DVB-T transmitter in GNU radio that he demonstrated at a recent OARC project session. Participants, using an inexpensive DVB-T dongle   that was controlled using the free application VLC were able to receive live  televison transmission originating in the classrooms. The demonstration was made at 913MHz and the transmission and reception has  also been tested  at 441 MHz and 1279 MHz. The inexpensive dongle worked well at all these amateur radio frequencies.</p>
