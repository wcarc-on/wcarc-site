<P>Ken Asmus, VA3KA, Treasurer, was absent.</P>
<P>Before the meeting we had a preliminary look at the&nbsp; Helix Antenna that 
David has constructed.&nbsp; Al showed a slick Antenna-to-Boom quick connect 
/disconnect bracket that is available from Ham Radio Outlet in the USA.&nbsp; 
This would be helpful for rover activities and other temporary installations for 
rapid deployment and dismounting of antennas.</P>
<P>Tom called the meeting to order at 7:30.&nbsp; He noted that elections will 
be held next month at the December meeting.&nbsp; Self-nominations (Volunteers ) 
are welcome.</P>
<P>APRS project - Brad gave an update.&nbsp; The 1274 TNC planned for the Prince 
of Wales Drive site does not work.&nbsp; Brad has a 1270 for this site.&nbsp; 
Minor upgrades will be made at Cornwall and Brockville, then Kingston - for 
which he has a TNC.&nbsp; Brad noted that the Rideau Lakes ARC is putting up an 
APRS digipeater, and another may be installed in the deep east, between Ottawa 
and Cornwall.</P>
<P>903 MHz Beacon - Graham reported that because of the damage to the original 
antenna, he is constructing an&nbsp; improved version for the Prince of Wales 
site.&nbsp; Parts are mostly made, awaiting assembly.</P>
<P>David writes a continuing series of articles on antennas, transmission lines 
and related subjects.&nbsp; These appear regularly in The Canadian Amateur and 
in a New Zealand journal.&nbsp; The articles usually require extensive research 
to prepare.&nbsp; David has a section on the RAC web site where background and 
complimentary material is available.&nbsp; There are interesting links here, and 
Java Applets that David has prepared for such things as predicting and 
calculating received signal strength, for example.&nbsp; Go to <A 
href="http://www.rac.ca">www.rac.ca</A>, then to TCA, then to Hot Links.</P>
<P>Tom will be giving a talk November 17 to the Ottawa Valley Mobile Club on his 
Rover expedition during the last VHF/UHF contest, complete with a PowerPoint 
presentation.&nbsp; Tom will show this to the WCARC at our December meeting.</P>
<P>Manfred reported that he has not done any more to date on his neat APRS 
decoder/display terminal.&nbsp; Members are looking forward to its completion 
and several have indicated that they would like to duplicate it.</P>
<P>Graham had a mini Show and Tell - bright blue and white LED 'tea lights', a 
good source of these LEDs for projects. These are expensive when you buy them in 
the raw at electronics supply stores.&nbsp; The tea lights are available for 
$1.95, complete with batteries, a micro-sized switch and a case that has to be 
cut apart to get at the goodies.</P>
<P>David showed and described his Helix antenna that he built for 435 MHz.&nbsp; 
This one is based on the Emerson model.&nbsp; Emerson and Cebik disagree with 
Kraus' (W8JK, SK) contention that in an axial-mode helix antenna, gain continues 
to increase with additional turns, to any practical length.&nbsp; The dimensions 
in the Emerson model, developed from computer modeling,&nbsp; are somewhat 
different from those defined by Kraus.&nbsp; David and Clare, VE3NPC, will be 
measuring the performance of this antenna and comparing it to one of similar 
size that is based on Kraus' design recommendations.</P>
<P><FONT color=#000000>There was some discussion of the Beveridge antenna for 
receiving on the 160 meter band.</FONT></P>
<P>A new project is being considered - to design and build circularly-polarized 
isotropic antennas for use next April in the world-wide isotropic antenna 
contest.</P>
<P>The next meeting will be on December 6, <FONT color=#000000>2005, with the 
election of officers, refreshments, and other festivities.</FONT> </P>
<P>The Kanata Room at Sobey's has been booked for December and January. </P>
