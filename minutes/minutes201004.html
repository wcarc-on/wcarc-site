<strong>Old Business:</strong>
<br>
        None<br><br>

<br>
<strong>New Business:</strong>
<br>
        The president invited discussion from members on efforts to improve the operations of the D-STAR repeater. The status of the D-STAR system is a standard item at WCARC meetings. Several WCARC members were instrumental in forming the informal Ottawa Amateur Radio Digital Group that successfully obtained grant financing to establish the system and they continue to operate it for the benefit of all amateurs in the region.  Recognizing that some expenses had already been incurred, Greg VA3OMB moved, seconded by John, VE3IAO, that the club provide OARDG with $157.  Several members noted that additional work was required.  Doug, VE3XK, seconded by John, VE3IAO moved an ammendment to increase the amount to $300.  The amendment carried 11 to 2.<br><br>
<br>

<strong>General Reports:</strong>
<br>
<br>
        Doug, VE3XK, reported that the beacons continue to operate nominally.  Because of the warm spring the semiannual adjustments required to maintain proper operating temperatures have been made earlier this year.<br><br>Glenn, VE3XRA, reported that work was continuing on the 5.8GHz telephones.<br><br>Bert, VE2ZAZ, commented on recent Earth-Moon-Earth communications at 432MHz using the Araceibo Radio Telescope in Puerto Rico.  Although only 60 watts transmitting power was used the 100 foot diameter antenna provided 60db gain making it easy for even modest stations to hear the signals.  He played recordings he had made of Araceibo transmission on SSB and CW.<br><br>
<br>

<strong>Presentation(s)/Activity:</strong>
<br><br>
Ray Perrin VE3FN, our guest speaker, described amateur microwave communications.  His presentation is posted on the WCARC website.<br><br>
<br>

<strong>Adjournment:</strong>
<br>
The President stated that there being no further business, the meeting would be adjourned.
The meeting was closed at 21:00 hours.
