<p>Tom, VA3NFA, greeted our guest
Ziggy, VE3RY - Duane, VA3ODD, arrived later in the evening.</p>

<p>Ken, VA3KA, our treasurer was
absent.</p>

<p>Rick, VE3CVG, reported that the
fleamarket at Carp was a success - good stuff and a good turnout. The RAC Symposium was well attended, with an
interesting talk on HF Beacons, and an expos&eacute; by Eric, VE3EI, of the ICOM
D-Star system and available equipment. ICOM is prepared to offer the same deal as in the USA - buy 2 M. and 440
MHz gear and ICOM will supply a 1.2 GHz repeater and controller. The object for Ottawa is to have the 144,
440 and 1.2 digital repeaters at the same location.</p>

<p>Re the 902 Band repeater project,
Rick indicated that he and Ken have 5 GTX Motorola mobiles and 2 handheld
transceivers functioning.</p>

<p>The 903 MHz beacon is functioning
and has been heard in Rochester NY.</p>

<p>The club made about $70.00 at
Carp. Jeff Milne, VE3EFF, made a
generous donation of $50 to the club; in recognition of this, Jeff has been
made an Honorary Member. There was also
a donation from Gregg, VE3YTZ.</p>

<p>Kieran's beacon is running 5
watts at 144.290 MHz, with CW identification at about 15 wpm. The beacon is about 250' from the house and
uses a horizontal loop antenna - callsign is VA3SJS. Kieran would appreciate strength reports.<br>
In consideration of his successful 144 MHz beacon implementation, Kieran has
been appointed 'Beacon Coordinator'. Congratulations, Kieran !! </p>

<p>With the VHF contest coming on
the following weekend, two or three rovers planned to be out - Tom, Dean, and
perhaps Brad.</p>

<p>The next meeting will be on October 3, 2006. This meeting will begin at 8:00 PM rather than at the usual time.</p>


<p>Graham Ide
VE3BYT<br>
Secretary.</p>
