The meeting was opened by the President, Mike Kennedy (VA3TEC), at 7:14 pm.
There was one visitor attending the meeting.

### Secretary's Report

- Bert (VE2ZAZ) posted a draft version of the May 2024 meeting minutes on the Club website prior to this meeting. Moved by him that the minutes be adopted as posted on the website. Seconded by Karen (VA3IGO). The motion was carried.

### Treasurer's Report

- Ray (VE3FN) reported: As of May 31st, 2024, we had $2,919.61 in our checking account. The difference from the previous month (April) was a payment of $110.00 to the City of Ottawa for the rental of the Kinburn site for the 2024 ARRL VHF contest, and $0.12 earned in interest.  There is an outstanding check of $100.00 payable to Ray Burrell VE3BVV for his expenses incurred in the 2023 ARRL VHF contest.  Either this check was not delivered or Ray Burrell has misplaced it. I anticipate that we will clear up this problem and, if approved, issue another check to VE3BVV for $100.00 for expenses incurred related to the 2024 ARRL VHF Contest. Our share account and our term deposits remain the same as in April 2024, at $15.00 and $2,185.44 respectively.
- The Club currently has 21 regular (paid) members and 3 life members.
