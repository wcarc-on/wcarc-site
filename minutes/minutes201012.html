<STRONG>Old Business:</STRONG> <BR>
<STRONG>Data Projector</STRONG><BR>Glenn, VE3XRA, reported that he had found an appropriate projector.

<STRONG>Beacons</STRONG><BR>The beacons were off the air for about 2 weeks following a short power outage in the district where they are located. Apparently a manual reset is required after an outage for them to return to service. Stan Madore, VA3SMM, who lives not far from the beacon location, has agreed to do the reset in the future when required. Members should contact <A href="mailto:stan@madore.ca">Stan VA3SMM</A>
if they are certain that the beacons are not operating.<BR><BR>
