### President's Report
- The Club had a table at the Carp hamfest held on September 9th. We received good feedback from the many who visited us. Mike (VA3TEC) had an operational demo of Digital Television over ham radio, and it attracted a lot of interest. The Club should plan to have a table also at the Iroquois and Smiths Falls hamfests in the spring. We could plan for a 10 GHz demo, or even 24 GHz police radar demo at these events.
- There will be a Simulated Emergency Test in October. "Operation Dark Skies" will be held in two parts on October 14 and October 16. Those interested in participating should consult the RAC website.

### Presentation(s)

### Old Business
- 903/1296 MHz Beacons: Bert (VE2ZAZ), Phil Lytle (VE3HOA) and Nick Shepherd (VE3OWV) installed our 903.360 MHz and 1296.060 MHz CW beacons at the Diefenbunker site, next to our other existing beacons. Bert will publish the micro-controller source code for the beacons on our Club's GitHub repository.
- Lawrence (VA3IQ): The Club's interest in providing advice on emergency communications to the Galetta Community Association Emergency Planning Committee. Lawrence reached out to the president of the emergency preparedness committee. Members of the committee have not contacted him back yet. A discussion on that matter between the Club Officers will then take place once they know more. The board will report back to the members at a future meeting.
- Monthly meeting room: Lawrence (VA3IQ) is suggesting to hold in-person meetings once every few months. A Saturday meeting is another possibility. He is also looking at organizing a Christmas event for the Annual General meeting.
