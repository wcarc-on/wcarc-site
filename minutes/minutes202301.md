### Officers Election
Since the outgoing Treasurer, Ray (VE3FN), was absent from the Annual General Assembly meeting, and had not indicated whether he would accept to carry on with the Treasurer duties, the election for that position was postponed to this month's meeting. Ray informed us that he had agreed to carry on with the Treasurer duties.

### Old Business
- 902/1296 MHz Beacons: Bert (VE2ZAZ) checked for the presence on the air of the 902 and 1296 MHz beacons, and both seem to be nonoperational. Ray (VE3FN) confirmed that had not heard them for months. The VE3ODG D-Star is back operational.

- 2023 June VHF Contest: Bert (VE2ZAZ) confirmed that the Kinburn Community building would be available for our VHF contest under the same conditions as last year's venue. A reservation was made. The contract will be reviewed and a reservation payment will be issued by the Treasurer.
