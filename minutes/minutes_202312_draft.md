### Opening
The meeting was opened by the President, Charles (VA3CPY) at 7:15 pm.
There were no visitors attending the meeting.

### Officer Election
Since next year will be an even-numbered year, the following positions were to be renewed at this Annual General Meeting: President, Secretary and Director. Thus, an election had to to take place.
- Secretary: Bert (VE2ZAZ) officially offered by email to carry on with the Secretary duties for another two-year term. No other candidates came forward at this meeting. Bert (VE2ZAZ) is thus re-elected by acclamation.
- The Officers present at the meeting being unsure of whether a quorum was reached, it was decided to defer the election of the President and Director positions until the January 2024 meeting. 
- Due to health reasons, the outgoing President cannot carry on his duties until a new President is elected. Thus the Vice President is taking over the President duties in the interim.
- Mike (VA3TEC), though not present, has offered to help the Club by getting involved on the Executive board. His role and/or position will be defined at the next meeting, granted that he is present then.

### Secretary's Report
- Bert (VE2ZAZ) was absent. Nonetheless, he posted a draft version of the November 2023 meeting minutes on the Club website prior to this meeting. The minutes will be voted and adopted at the next meeting.

### Treasurer's Report
- Ray (VE3FN) reported: The balance in our daily banking accounts is up by $0.11 to $2,734.52.  Our term deposit balances stand at a total of $2,185.44, which is unchanged from last month.  The balance in our share account remains at $15.00.
- The Club currently has 24 regular members and 3 life members. The Club lost one life member, Kieran (VA3KS), who sadly passed away during the month of November.

### Vice President's Report
