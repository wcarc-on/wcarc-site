He will also send a $50 cheque to both Lawrence (VA3IQ) and Randy (VE3AX) to compensate for gas expenditures incurred in the retrieval and return of the contest equipment.

### Vice President's Report
- Lawrence is working on setting up some amateur radio satellite operation training, a 90 minute presentation, given by a ham operator affiliated with AMSAT. He will likely book the speaker for the September meeting.

### President's Report
- The Club had a successful 2022 VHF contest. The members can all be proud of that feat. Charles took several pictures of the event; these are [available on his Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?vanity=charles.macdonald&set=a.10220076298849101). There will be a few articles written on the event, [one by the westcarletononline.com web site](https://westcarletononline.com/wc-amateur-radio-club-competes-in-kinburn/) and another one by Kinburn News. Our event will also be covered in a RAC TCA magazine article.

### Show and tell
None.

### Old Business
- VHF/UHF Beacons: Since we have received an authorization from the DARC officers to move the Club beacon to the Diefenbunker, we shall proceed with the move. We will plan a visit of the Diefenbunker site in July. John (VA3JYK) can be our liaison with the DARC, as he is a member of both Clubs.
- VHF Contest. Clayton (VE3IRR) gave a report on the contest results and also provided a list of improvements. A few items came out as follow up actions in preparation for next year's VHF contest.
   - The Club shall purchase a 432 MHz long boom antenna. The one we used was a loaner and will not be available next year.
   - It would be advisable to stock up on spare bolts and nuts to cover all of the antenna hardware we use.

### New Business
None.

### Ask the Club
No questions were asked.

### Adjournment
