Tom, VA3NFA, greeted our guest
Ziggy, VE3RY. Duane, VA3ODD, arrived later in the evening.

Ken, VA3KA, our treasurer was
absent.

Rick, VE3CVG, reported that the
fleamarket at Carp was a success - good stuff and a good turnout. The RAC Symposium was well attended, with an
interesting talk on HF Beacons, and an expos√© by Eric, VE3EI, of the ICOM
D-Star system and available equipment. ICOM is prepared to offer the same deal as in the USA - buy 2m and 440
MHz gear and ICOM will supply a 1.2 GHz repeater and controller. The object for Ottawa is to have the 144,
440 and 1.2 digital repeaters at the same location.

Re the 902 Band repeater project,
Rick indicated that he and Ken have 5 GTX Motorola mobiles and 2 handheld
transceivers functioning.

The 903 MHz beacon is functioning
and has been heard in Rochester, NY.

The club made about $70.00 at
Carp. Jeff Milne, VE3EFF, made a
generous donation of $50 to the club; in recognition of this, Jeff has been
made an Honorary Member. There was also
a donation from Greg, VE3YTZ.

Kieran's beacon is running 5
watts at 144.290 MHz, with CW identification at about 15 wpm. The beacon is about 250' from the house and
uses a horizontal loop antenna - callsign is VA3SJS. Kieran would appreciate strength reports.
In consideration of his successful 144 MHz beacon implementation, Kieran has
been appointed "Beacon Coordinator". Congratulations, Kieran!

With the VHF contest coming on
the following weekend, two or three rovers planned to be out - Tom, Dean, and
perhaps Brad.

The next meeting will be on October 3, 2006. This meeting will begin at 8:00 PM rather than at the usual time.

Graham Ide VE3BYT  
Secretary.
