<strong>Vice President's Report</strong>
<br>The Vice Present, Doug Leach (VE3XK) reported that Greg Milley (VA3ITB) had donated a 30' tower to the club to go along with the 3 rotators that he had previously
donated. This equipments will be used at the June VHF contest and other club activities. This prompted comments of appreciation from many members and led to the

plaque of appreciation. Seconded by Richard Ferch (VE3KI). Carried.

<strong>Reports and Project Updates:</strong><br><br>
<strong>Beacons</strong><br>
Doug Leach reported that the 4 lower beacons would soon be installed on the tower of Richard Ferch (VE3KI). The cabinet containing the beacon electronics would be located
indoors, a major advantage over the arrangement used previously as it solved both temperature control and access issues associated with the previous outdoor arrangement.
The only additional equipment required for the installation would be surge suppressors. Doug made the following motion: That the club purchase appropriate surge protectors
at a cost of about $125 (allowing for currency exchange variations). Seconded by Peter Jago (VA3PJ). Carried.<br>

levels on this band.

<strong>Ramsey Lasers</strong><br>
  Bert Zauhar (VE2ZAZ) distributed the laser kits he had ordered on behalf of club members. He reported that he had no difficulty assembling and testing the transmitter
