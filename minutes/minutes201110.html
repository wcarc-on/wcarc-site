  <STRONG>Opening:</STRONG><BR>The 
  meeting was opened by President Al Penney(VO1NO) at 19:30 hours. <BR>The 
  President welcomed three guests to the meeting: Norm Rashleigh (VE3LC), Barry 
  Allison (VE3NJK), Ken Evans (not licenced yet).<BR><BR>
  As the first order of 
  Business the President called on Mr.Rob McLachlan of the Department of Planning and 
  Growth Management of the City of Ottawa to outline the proposed Ottawa Antenna Policy Municipal 
  Concurrence and Public Consultation Process for Ottawa. (The proposed process 
  and accompanying documents can be found at 
<a href="http://www.ottawa.ca/residents/public_consult/antenna/index_en.html">http://www.ottawa.ca/residents/public_consult/antenna/index_en.html</a>).</p>
<p> Mr.McLachlan noted that the process will be developed in accordance with Industry 
  Canada's regulatory framework. The section of the City of Ottawa site plan 
  control bylaw, dealing with communication tower proposals, will be deleted. Mr. 
  MacLachlan outlined the proposed simplified consultation process for Residential 
  Use Antenna Systems (such as thoses used by amateur radio operators) including 
  exemptions that would determine when consultation was not necessary before 
  proceeding. He answered questions and participated in a lively discussion with 
  the members and guests present. The President thanked Mr.McLachlan for 
  attending and participating in the discussion.<BR>

<STRONG>Old 
    Business:</STRONG> <BR>
  <strong>Dues</strong><BR>
    At the previous meeting a motion to increase the 
  dues had been moved and seconded and after discussion deferred to the October 
  meeting. The President provided the meeting with an overview of income and 
  expenses of the club over the past 3 years. The major source of income was 
  membership dues. Membership had remained roughly constant over the 3 years with a slight decrease this year. The club also earned income from sales at local fleamarkets each year. However, there had been 
  significant revenue from sales of donated equipment in 2009 and 2010 that met or 
  exceeded the revenue from membership those years and no such revenue in 2011. The 
  major change in expenditures was an increase in the cost of RAC insurance that 
  tripled from 2010 to 2011. The club expenditure on the annual VHF Expedition was 
  cut in half for 2011.<BR><BR>The deferred motion from the previous meeting was 
  reintroduced to be voted on: 
<br>Moved By Bert (VE2ZAZ), seconded by Stan (VA3SMM) 
  that the membership dues be increased from $20 (per year) to 
  $25 (per year).<BR>Carried.<BR>[Web master's Note: It is assumed, subject to change at the November meeting, that the dues amount is the per year amount. It is further assumed that the dues change is effective immediately.]
