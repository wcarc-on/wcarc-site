<p>Rick, VE3CVG, reported that club
finances are in good shape (Treasurer Ken, VA3KA, is away). The 903 MHz beacon is operating well.<br>
Not much change on the 902 band repeater - the filters are tuned and the system
is almost ready to go at the YMCA building.<br>
Rick noted that Norm, VE3LC, is assisting RAC at the RABC on the Smart Meters
issue.</p>

<p>In somewhat vernacular terms,
Graham, VE3BYT, (also Secretary of the Saint Lawrence Valley Repeater Council)
expressed his considerable anguish and disappointment that only one person from
all of Ottawa, Gatineau and New York State combined came to the SLVRC General
Meeting on May 12 to report on their systems and to support the deliberations
of the Council. This meeting was held
following the fleamarket in Smiths Falls.</p>

<p>About Field Day, the involvement
of the WCARC has been cancelled for lack of interest and support. Rick will be active in the east end.</p>

<p>Re DStar, the Internet link is
not operational as yet. There are 8 or
9 capable with DStar, a little lower participation than expected. The 23Cm radio is the next phase.</p>

<p>The VHF/UHF contest is the 9
&amp; 10 of June. Tom, VA3NFA, and
Dean, VE3CDD, will be active Rovers on bands from 50 to 1296 MHz.</p>

<p>Tom reported that the 432 beacon
is on the air, on 432.310. Reports are
needed now that the leaves are out.</p>

<p>Doug, VE3XK, Webmaster of the
QCWA Chapter 70 web site, reported that he has added some helpful links to
operating aids including propagation forecasts, and maps showing real-time
VHF/UHF activity in Europe. </p>

<p>Tom asked for suggestions for
activities or presentations for the July meeting.</p>

<p>The next meeting will be on July 3, 2007.</p>

<p>Graham Ide VE3BYT<br>
Secretary.</p>
