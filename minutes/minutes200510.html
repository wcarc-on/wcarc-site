</TABLE>
</P>

<P>Ken Asmus, VA3KA, Treasurer, was absent.</P>

<P>Introductions were made around the table.</P>

<P>Tom showed photographs of his setup and locations from his successful Rover activities in the VHF/UHF contest in September. This was a great job by Tom and Brad, with lots of contacts.  They drove 460 KM and had 185 QSOs - around 14,000 points, on six bands in six grids.  Tom plans to repeat the Rover effort again in June 2006, with some improvements to antenna mounting methods.</P>

<P>Dean is considering operating in Algonquin Park, FN05, in the June 2006 contest.</P>

<P>Rick reported that there have been lots of hits on the WCARC web site.   Rick is searching for transverters for all the bands for which beacons will be aired - 144, 430 and on up to violet light.  Rick's plan is to feed all transverters from a common 28 MHz IF driver, and at the same time.</P>

<P>Rick showed the ATV downconverter that he and Ken, VA3KA, have built to receive VE3TVA on 914 MHz.  These are the North Country Rx converter DCNV900, about $80C for the kit.</P>

<P>Doug noted that SSB Electronics offers a 900 MHz LNA with TR switching.  Doug was able to receive good signals from VE3TVA with only some sparkle at his QTH in the western boonies.</P>

<P>When a number of stations are able to work through VE3TVA, it will be an asset for local Emergency/ARES activities</P>

<P>Brad reported on APRS matters.  He has acquired an MFJ TNC from Jeff, gratis.  Jeff downloaded the utilities for operation on the 144.390 MHz network.  Sean has a receiver for about $40 that will be installed in a rack at a site on Prince of Wales Drive.  Another ROM has been burned and installed in VE3DVQ at Lavant - it's working well.</P>

<P>Brad will possibly fix VE3UEZ near Kingston as well.  This needs a new TNC.</P>

<P>Doug will approach Phil, VE3CIQ, about the possibility of mounting the 903 MHz beacon on Prince of Wales. (Note:  Doug has spoken to Phil.  This can be done.  The antenna can be mounted on a second tower that is not used for commercial clients).  This should be a great site.</P>

<P>The 903 MHz Skew-Planar Wheel antenna for the 903 beacon was returned to Graham for refurbishing.  This antenna, after a short period of installation on the Lee Valley Tools building, was suffering from corrosion and crud, and an element was broken.  Graham will construct a new beacon antenna that will be better protected against the elements of nature, whatever kind they might be.</P>

<P>Rick reported that four stations are capable now on weak signal work on 903 MHz.  Four Transverter kits remain to be completed.</P>

<P>Al Penney is active in the VHF/UHF contests.  He will be on 1296 MHz with an FT857 and Transverter.</P>

<P>An active discussion took place presenting differing points of view on Helical Antennas - design, gain, and the relative merits of the Kraus, Cebik and Emerson models.  This was followed by opinions as to the optimum spacing for stacking of antennas - over antennas in the same band, and in different bands.</P>

<P>A stimulating time was had by all present.  </P>

<P>The next meeting will be on November 1, 2005 </P>

<P>Graham Ide VE3BYT Secretary.</P><BR>
