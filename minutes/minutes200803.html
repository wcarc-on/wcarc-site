<p><span lang=EN-CA style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Our Treasurer Ken Asmus, VA3KA,
and our Secretary Barney Baker, VA3BGB, were both away.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ken is enjoying winter up north somewhere,
and Barney is enjoying it much more down in Barbados.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>President Al, VO1NO, outlined the
agenda and welcomed our guests.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Introductions were made in turn around the room.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>V.P. Doug, VE3XK, said he would
later outline the results of his committee's work to develop a new constitution
for the club.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Doug mentioned at this
time that the 430 band beacon is functioning, on 432.358 MHz.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Dale, VE3XZT, mentioned that the
HF conditions are picking up - particularly on 20, 17 and 15 Metres.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Al discussed the Grid Expedition
planned for the June VHF/UHF Contest, at the intersection of the FN03, 04, 13
and 14 grids.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The objective is to be
the Top Gun MultiOperator Station in Canada.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is expected that Rovers will come by this QTH as well.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Graham, VE3BYT, mentioned that so
far two members (Dale, VE3XZT, and Ken, VA3KA for early summer) had indicated
an interest in a high-altitude balloon development and launch, or a project of
a similar nature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This will be pursued
in future when and if more members are interested in working on it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There was some interest in Pop Bottle
Rockets - water powered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There could be
interesting potential here for short-period telemetry.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was noted that the school group in Perth
assisted by local radio amateurs has a second launch planned for April and that
WCC members will be available to assist with this.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The DStar repeaters are reported
to currently have around 24 users in the area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>New software will allow gateways without fixed IP addresses.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Al listed off the contests and
other activities coming up in the near future.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>There are a considerable number of fleamarkets scheduled in April and
May.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Graham noted that the Saint
Lawrence Valley Repeater Council spring meeting would be held the same day as
the Smiths Falls Fleamarket (at 1:00 PM), as was done last year.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Greater participation is needed.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Doug showed his work to date on
the coordinated beacon project that will include beacons for several bands in
one container with the power supply and distribution, controller and a common
keyer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So far, the 432 beacon is up and
running.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Doug's work is impressive with
the modules in the electrical box, all well vented and screened.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The box is ready for mounting on the tower
at Doug's QTH until the next transmitter is acquired and is ready for
integration.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Graham has a temperature sensor
(DS18B20) running on a PicAxe 28X1 microcontroller.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>This sensor will report temperature to two decimal places and is
an example of environmental sensors that can be used on the balloon project,
along with others such as for atmospheric pressure/altitude.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Graham showed a tiny transmitter running on
433.92 MHz, currently sending a morse ID and message.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>This can be used for remote monitoring of various sensors over a
range of about 75 Metres or more with a simple antenna.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In the room, the signal overloaded his
FT-817.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>David,
VE3KL, presented a live demonstration of his CW station controller
project.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The controller uses a VB.Net
VE3KL program that interfaces with his station system components with a single
interface. At this time the components include: a VE3KL CW keyer, a K1El keyer,
and an Elecraft SWR/Power meter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>David
is now expanding the suite to include RTTY sending/receiving, logging and antenna
switching.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is a long term ongoing
project aimed at integrating all of his components into a single command module.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Doug and Dean, VA3CDD, have
prepared a draft constitution for the WCARC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Doug made a comprehensive presentation article by article of the
committee's proposal including a rationale for each.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Although comment and discussion on the details was not encouraged
at this point, inevitably there was some, due to the considerable interest of
the members.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The presentation on the
draft constitution will be on the WCARC web site for information and
review.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Members may send comments and
proposed amendments to President Al, with copies to Doug and Dean for their
consideration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The draft constitution
will be presented for approval (or amendment) and acceptance at a future
meeting.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Al expressed the Club's thanks
for the extensive work that Doug and Dean have done on researching and
preparing the draft constitution.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The next meeting will be on <span
style='color:black'>April 1</span>, 2008.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Graham Ide VE3BYT&nbsp;<br>
