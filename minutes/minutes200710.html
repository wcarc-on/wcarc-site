<p>Due to a prior booking for the room
by another group, the assembly moved to the picnic tables outdoors at Sobey's
in Kanata. Fortunately it was pleasant
weather (i.e., it was not snowing).</p>

<p>Rick, VE3CVG, gave an outline of
progress on the DStar repeater installation. Ying Hum, VE3FUB, has offered to put on a demonstration of the Internet
link on the 1240 MHz band, probably on October 9.</p>

<p>Ken, VA3KA, put out a request for
funds in support of the DStar project. On motion of Al, VO1NO, seconded by Barney, VA3BGB, the club would
donate $101.00 for system upkeep. Carried.</p>

<p>Graham, VE3BYT, suggested that
the club initiate a project that might involve a majority of the members,
something of general interest. The
object is to engage members to achieve a project generally beyond their individual
capabilities and to gain expertise and broaden our interests. A high-altitude balloon launch could be an
interesting example. Graham outlined
the elements of such a launch project. This outline is attached as an addendum to these minutes. Considerable interest was expressed in such
a project. This will be discussed more
fully at future meetings.</p>

<p>Rick suggested also a
group-building project such as a Software Defined Radio.</p>

<p>Al offered to lead a DXpedition
maybe to FN05, Algonquin Park area, at contest time in June 2008. This would be multi-operator, low power, up
to 10 GHz. Rick offered to be cook for
the expedition, in addition to operating, of course. Al suggested a DXpedition Down East, ideally at St. Johns, NF, to
attempt a Trans-Atlantic QSO on the 144 MHz band. This will be considered in the future - it could be exciting.</p>

<p>Development of any of these
projects will require special meetings. Graham will present again the proposal for a possible balloon launch
project at a future meeting and Al will plan a DXpedition to Algonquin Park.</p>

<p>Rick wondered if the club beacons
might be located at VO1NO. Al suggested
another good location might be at Brad's, VE3BSM.</p>

<p>Doug, VE3XK, will take over the
construction and packaging of the 222 MHz beacon.</p>

<p>Carl, VE8CF, indicated that he
and Aaron Hall are experimenting with Free Energy, a la Nicola Tesla, near
Perth. This is interesting, and will
bear closer examination in future.</p>

<p>Tom, VA3NFA, reminded everyone
that club elections will be held at the December meeting. Tom will not be running for President. Secretary's note: Graham, VE3BYT, will not
be running for Secretary.</p>

<p>Rick showed his kit for the 10
GHz Transverter from Down East Microwave. Rick mentioned that parts were missing, and the instructions are poor and
inadequate. This is a poor show on the
part of DEMI.</p>

<p>The next meeting will be on November 6, 2007.</p>

<p>Addendum:</p>

<h3>High Altitude Balloon Launch - potential club project</h3>

<p>Object of project:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Opportunity to acquire new experience, broaden interests</li>
  <li>Gather expertise, and data and photographs from near space</li>
  <li>Present results of the effort to other clubs and on the Internet</li>
</ul>

<p>Major components of project:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Preliminary planning, development of specifications, choice and acquisition of equipment, programming of controller</li>
  <li>Design and construct the Flight Package, balloon and parachute</li>
  <li>Plan and execute the launch</li>
  <li>Prepare Ground Station with mapping, tracking, acquisition of data by telemetry, etc., logging of data</li>
  <li>Recovery of payload</li>
  <li>Analysis and plotting of data</li>
</ul>

<p>Example - Flight Package Payload might include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>VHF and HF Beacons, cw, voice, PSK31, APRS, etc.</li>
  <li>TinyTrak, APRS Transmitter</li>
  <li>GPS Receiver</li>
  <li>Radar Reflector</li>
  <li>Digital Cameras - horizontal and vertical (down)</li>
  <li>Controller/Computer</li>
  <li>Sensors for Atmospheric Pressure, various Temperatures, Humidity, etc.</li>
  <li>Antennas, Power supplies, containers, hardware</li>
  <li>Even a Cross-Band Repeater, e.g. on the 144 and 440 MHz bands.</li>
</ul>

<p>It would be best to
launch first with a limited flight package, followed by more complex systems on
future launches if there is interest. Possible embellishment: Haul aloft a glider with GPS, APRS and flight
controls that will detach at say 50,000 feet and Fly Back to the launch site!</p>
