Other than with some old business actions, things have been quiet.

### Presentation 
None at this meeting, as the presenter did not show up.

### Old Business
- 902/1296 MHz Beacons: Bert (VE2ZAZ) is waiting for an update from Jeff (VE3EFF) on the opportunity to retrieve our beacons from the YMCA roof top site. Bert will contact Jeff (VE3EFF) again to see whether there is some development.
- VE3ODG DStar equipment: Phil (VE3HOA) and Jeff (VE3EFF) would like to recover the VE3ODG DStar equipment located at the YMCA. The equipment would be reused by the Almonte Club. Back in 2007, WCARC gave $300 to support the VE3ODG DStar project. This would explain why he is contacting us. During this meeting, it was agreed that the WCARC would not use that equipment in the future, and that the were welcome to recover the equipment.
- 432 MHz Yagi Antenna procurement: No update. Bert (VE2ZAZ) will contact Ken (VA3KA) in March to remind him of our needs. Ken will have two 432 MHz long boom yagis for sale in the spring. 
-WCARC badges: Lawrence (VA3IQ) mentioned that no progress had been made on that matter since the last meeting.
- Leftover Club tower sections at VA3KA's place: Ken (VA3KA) informed the Club that there still were WCARC-owned tower sections in storage on his property. Wayne (VE3CZO) went to Ken (VA3KA)'s place and inventoried the tower sections on the premise. There are five steel sections (40 feet total), one section has a top shelf but no rotator shelf. There are also four aluminum tower sections (30 feet total) on the premise. Finally, there is a smaller diameter steel section. The Club will offer the aluminum tower sections back to Luc (VE3JGL), who was the original owner. We shall also make the steel tower sections available to anyone in exchange for a donation to the Club. We will address this in the Spring.

### New Business
- WCARC Winter POTA (Parks On The Air): Laurence (VA3IQ) proposed a one-day activation at the Baxter Conservation Area shelter. We would set up inside a cabin. The rental fee for the cabin is $65 per day. We could deploy an end-fed antenna with a triplexer splitter for the 40m, 20m and 10m bands. It would likely be a battery operation. The members present at the meeting showed interest in the activity. Lawrence will visit the site in advance and report back to the Club. 
- RAC YOTA (Youth On The Air) Summer Camp: Charles (VA3CPY) informed us that RAC is organizing a YOTA summer camp to be held in July 2023. This could be an interesting activity for the Club to get involved in. More to follow.

### Show and tell
- Wayne showed a prototype of his laser communicator, a device that can replace the Ramsey units that we use during the summer VHF contest. It will be a complete transceiver on one board.

### Ask the Club
- Mike (VA3TEC) showed a 902 MHz antenna and asked for some input on the type and polarization of the antenna.

### Adjournment
The President observed that there was no further business; the meeting was adjourned at 9:07 pm.
