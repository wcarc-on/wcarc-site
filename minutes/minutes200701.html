<p>President Tom, VA3NFA, welcomed
our guests Shelley, VE1NOS, Jeremy, and Bill, W4TAA. Bill said he would be putting up some antennas for VHF and
UHF bands on his farm near Almonte.</p>

<p>Tom reviewed the agenda for the
meeting, and asked for reports.</p>

<p> Rick, VE3CVG, reported that the web site is updated with new
information, including a list of members with their Maidenhead Grid locations
and some pictures from the December 2006 meeting. </p>

<p> Ken, VA3KA, reported on the club finances (good shape) and that
we have 21 paid up members at present.</p>

<p><br>
 Graham, VE3BYT, noted that the
minutes are on the web site for all meetings held in 2006.</p>

<p>Tom observed that when he plugged
a power supply into the club's MFJ Antenna Analyser he immediately detected a
slight excess of smoke. It turns out
that the batteries in the beast were corroded and dribbling gunk - probably not
a good sign. Rick will look this over
to see if the analyser can be resuscitated.</p>

<p>WCARC beacons -Tom reported on
the progress of the beacons development for the 222 and 430 MHz bands. Tom's 432 beacon test transmissions from
Kanata have received good reception reports from around the area. The 432 beacon consists of a transverter
driven by an HTX-100, with an IDomatic keyer. For 222, Tom has a small transmitter, but needs an amplifier. We are in need of a suitable site for these
beacons. Tom noted that the transverter
for 432 gets quite warm. For continuous
unattended beacon use it would be proper technique to provide adequate cooling,
with (RF shielded) holes in the case and even a small 12-volt fan to move air
through it.</p>

<p>The club's 903 MHz beacon was
heard in South-western Ontario during a recent tropospheric opening. Apparently some big guns on VHF/UHF are
looking forward to our family of Ottawa-area VHF and UHF beacons.</p>

<p>Norm, VE3LC, has generously
undertaken to build a Big Wheel antenna for the 222 MHz beacon. Graham will build a little Big Wheel for the
432 beacon.</p>

<p>Rick, VE3CVG made a short
presentation on suitable operating techniques for working the VHF and UHF
contests, covering etiquette, antennas, using CW, and calling methods. The slides for this are on the web site. Ken, VA3KA passed out a sheet on the ARRL
VHF Sweepstakes Contest with a list of suggested frequencies for most bands.</p>

<p>Al, VO1NO, described his
Beveridge Antenna farm in progress and showed his system of switching a number
of antennas for achieving eight directions. The antennas are to be about two wavelengths long, about eight feet
above ground. A receiving test brought
in a regional station in Korea.</p>

<p>Al and Tom are planning some
efforts at communication by Laser. Hmmm. Perhaps we need a repeater
in the Ottawa area on VLB, the Visible Light Band - with input on Red, output
on Green.</p>

<p>Rick, on behalf of himself and
Ken, provided an update on the D-STAR and 902 MHz band repeater projects.<br><br>
 Their requested grant for the D-STAR
project has been approved: $16.5K. ICOM
has been advised that the project is on the way. Details are on the OARDG web site - link from the WCARC site
under Projects. An application for
frequency coordinations has been made to the Saint Lawrence Valley Repeater
Council. The intention is to install
digital repeaters on the 144 and 430 bands (digital voice and data) and on the
1.2 GHz band (digital voice and data, plus high-speed data). A suitable site is needed to permit good
coverage of the Capital area and beyond.</p>

<p> The 902 band FM repeater project is progressing, with 5 handheld
and 5 mobile radios programmed. A
duplexer is on hand. A repeater may
become operational this winter. A
suitable site is required. Details can
be found through the link on the WCARC web site under Projects.</p>

<p>Manfred, VA3WK, gave us an
introduction to the new generation of digital proportional radio control
equipment that has become available. Some of this gear operates on the 902 MHz and 2.4 GHz bands. Receivers
are extremely small and light, and respond only to their own transmitters,
permitting a number of operators on a band at once with out fear of frequency
conflicts. Manfred showed an indoor
flier, about eight inches long, with full controls. Wings and control surfaces are covered with Saran-like
plastic. Historical note: Surfacing material for indoor fliers was
many years ago made by floating dissolved plastic on a water surface until the
solvent evaporated, and then skimming the remaining film off with a wire
loop. It was a delicate operation to
build one of these planes. Manfred also
showed his new 2-cycle engine for a P47 Thunderbolt that will have an 84-inch
wingspan. This engine is a respectable
by model standards - 35 cc displacement. It will swing a 20-inch propeller, runs on a gasoline-oil fuel mixture
and has electronic ignition.</p>

<p>The next meeting will be on February 6, 2007.</p>

<p>Graham Ide VE3BYT<br>
Secretary.</p>
