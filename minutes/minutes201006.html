<br>

<Strong>General Reports:</Strong>
<br>
<br>
        The beacons were discussed briefly - noting that occassionally the final character in the sequence was truncated.  This may be an issue with the programming and not easily remedied.<br><br>Rick VE3CVG reported that the upgrade of D-STAR repeater system VA3ODG was underway to increase reliability and security. A newer computer has been obtained to replace the previous server and new equipment for the internet link.<br><br>Rick, VE3CVG reported that the company hosting the club website had stopped operations.  A new host was found but because of unresolved issues over the registration of the internet domain the web address could not be transferred.  The club website can now be accessed at www.wc-arc.org.   The site contains a great deal of information including presentations made at meetings and coantains minutes of all meetings over the past 6 years.<br><br>Doug VE3XK, reported that the club's 2m FM repeater (147.240MHz) and UHF FM repeater are off the air.  The owners of our former site in Franktown asked that the equipment be removed and Dale VE3XZT very quickly went in and took the considerable pile of equipment out.  While efforts are still underway, the growing tendency of tower owners to require payment for access, means that there are fewer available locations.<BR><BR>
<br>

<Strong>Presentation(s)/Activity:</Strong>
<br><br>
	 Bert, VE2ZAZ, provided an interesting and informative discussion of spectrum analyzers and network analyzer and their use in amateur radiuo.  A copy of his presentation can be found on the club website.<BR><BR>
<br>

<Strong>Adjournment:</Strong>
<br>
The the president stated that there being no further business, the meeting was adjourned.
