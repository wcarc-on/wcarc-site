brought the meeting to order at 7:30.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Arial'>Rick, VE3CVG, Vice President and
Webmaster, was away.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Arial'>Ken, VA3KA, Treasurer, reported
that the club finances are in good shape, and that membership stands at 28 at
present.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Arial'>Graham, VE3BYT, Secretary -
nothing to report.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Arial'>Ken reported that he had picked
up some mobile and handheld units at Rochester, programmed for a number of
channels in the 902-928 MHz band.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
mobiles have about 15 watts output.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Repeater channels use a 25 MHz separation - input/output.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ken and Rick are planning 902 band
repeaters, one in the east and one in the west, linked together probably on the
440 band.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Doug, VE3XK, donated a filter
to the project.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Arial'>Ken also reported that Digital
Everything is coming to town.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ken,
Rick, and a group of interested members are looking into the potential
applications of D-Star equipment and the likely establishment of a digital
repeater on the 1240 band in Ottawa.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>ICOM has equipment for the 144, 430 and 1240 MHz bands and may have
incentives for equipment purchases.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Currently, equipment for 1.2 GHz is priced around $1100C.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Applications for personal and emergency
operations and special events are numerous, with the ability to pass text and
graphics as well as voice and with connections to the Internet.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Members should advise Ken if they are
interested in the D-Star developments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>

There is a discussion forum on D-Star at

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Arial'>Apparently Vancouver and Calgary
(three bands) are on the air with D-Star, and Montreal and Toronto are coming
on line soon.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Arial'>Al, VO1NO, will be going to the
Magdalen Islands for the Islands on the Air Contest.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Activity will include 2 and 6 M. as well as 160 - 10 M.<span

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Arial'>Doug mentioned a tower and

</span>This needs a few volunteers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>John, VE3IAO, expressed interest.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Arial'>The club's Field Day activities
with the Lanark/North Leeds ARES Group were very successful with 1063 QSOs in
total, around 4300 points.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This should
place the operation in the top five in Canada for its class.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There was an Es opening on 6 M. to Georgia,
South Carolina and Florida.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There were
no injuries or mishaps during the event, and everyone had a fun time.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Arial'>Congratulations and thanks to Al,
VO1NO, for his phenomenal job of organizing the Field Day exercise.</span></p>
