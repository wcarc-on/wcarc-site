<p>President Tom, VA3NFA,
brought the meeting to order at 7:30.</p>

<p>Rick, VE3CVG, Vice President and
Webmaster, was away.</p>

<p>Ken, VA3KA, Treasurer, reported
that the club finances are in good shape, and that membership stands at 28 at
present.</p>

<p>Graham, VE3BYT, Secretary -
nothing to report.</p>

<p>Ken reported that he had picked
up some mobile and handheld units at Rochester, programmed for a number of
channels in the 902-928 MHz band. The
mobiles have about 15 watts output. Repeater channels use a 25 MHz separation - input/output. Ken and Rick are planning 902 band
repeaters, one in the east and one in the west, linked together probably on the
440 band. Doug, VE3XK, donated a filter
to the project.</p>

<p>Ken also reported that Digital
Everything is coming to town. Ken,
Rick, and a group of interested members are looking into the potential
applications of D-Star equipment and the likely establishment of a digital
repeater on the 1240 band in Ottawa. ICOM has equipment for the 144, 430 and 1240 MHz bands and may have
incentives for equipment purchases. Currently, equipment for 1.2 GHz is priced around $1100C. Applications for personal and emergency
operations and special events are numerous, with the ability to pass text and
graphics as well as voice and with connections to the Internet. Members should advise Ken if they are
interested in the D-Star developments.

There is a discussion forum on D-Star at
<a href="http://www.k5tit.org/"> http://www.k5tit.org/</a> Also see <a href="http://www.icomamerica.com/support/forums/">http://www.icomamerica.com/support/forums/ </a>
and check the local web pages at <a href="https://va3odg.webqth.com/">https://va3odg.webqth.com/</a></p>

<p>Apparently Vancouver and Calgary
(three bands) are on the air with D-Star, and Montreal and Toronto are coming
on line soon.</p>

<p>Al, VO1NO, will be going to the
Magdalen Islands for the Islands on the Air Contest. Activity will include 2 and 6 M. as well as 160 - 10 M. Al may try WSJT meteor scatter.</p>

<p>Doug mentioned a tower and
rotator are available free for taking it down. This needs a few volunteers. John, VE3IAO, expressed interest.</p>

<p>The club's Field Day activities
with the Lanark/North Leeds ARES Group were very successful with 1063 QSOs in
total, around 4300 points. This should
place the operation in the top five in Canada for its class. There was an Es opening on 6 M. to Georgia,
South Carolina and Florida. There were
no injuries or mishaps during the event, and everyone had a fun time.</p>

<p>Congratulations and thanks to Al,
VO1NO, for his phenomenal job of organizing the Field Day exercise.</p>

<p>The next meeting will
be on August 1, 2006 in the Kanata Room at Sobey's.</p>

<p>Graham Ide
VE3BYT<br>
Secretary.</p>
