<p>In the absence of President Al
VO1NO, Vice President Doug VE3XK called the meeting to order at 19h40 and
requested guests, then all members to introduce themselves.</p>

<p>Doug then circulated the proposed
agenda and asked for any additions or deletions - of which there were none.</p>

<p><b><u>Reports</u></b></p>


<p>Al VO1NO/VE3 provided a written
Annual Presidents Report, which Doug circulated. Doug reviewed each item with the members. He requested that the
report be placed on the website. Rick VE3CVG agreed that he would place it in
the historical section.</p>


<p>Treasurer Ken VE3KA reported that
the bank balance was $459.00. An
additional $300.00 in member's dues was received during this meeting. Ken
mentioned that he will provide a year end report at the next meeting. He is
pursuing a change of banks to escape the $4/mo service charges presently
charged by Royal Bank on chequing accounts. He has found that most banks have adopted similar charges. The PC bank
service does not provide chequing. Bank of Montreal (BMO) provides a Community
Account with a moderate per-cheque charge, and our account will probably be
moved to the local BMO branch at Signature Centre, Kanata</p>


<p>Secretary Barney VA3BGB moved
that the minutes of the November 4, 2008 meeting be accepted as published. Rick
VE3CVG seconded the motion - it was passed. </p>

<p>Rick mentioned that the corrected
minutes for the October 7, 2008 meeting had not been approved. Barney asked
that the members review those minutes for approval at the next meeting.</p>

<p>Doug VE3XK suggested that the
minutes be reviewed initially by the executive, prior to submission to the
webmaster for publishing on the website. He also suggested that the small WCARC logo should be added to the top of
subsequent minutes.</p>

<p><b><u>Webmaster</u></b></p>

<p>Webmaster Rick VE3CVG stated that
the web site is operational and all submissions have been posted. He is continuing his efforts toward the
transfer of the club's website domain name from Rene VA3XK, to himself. Rick is working with Manfred to accomplish
this transfer.</p>

<p><b><u>Repeaters</u></b></p>

<p>Repeater Committee Chair Dale
VE3XZT mentioned that work on the repeaters is now completed. A new CW identification chip, programmed
with the club callsign VE3WCC/R, has
been installed in the 2M repeater and the repeater tested OK. The repeater will be re-installed this week
at the Franktown tower site by Phil VE3CIQ. The 70CM repeater is working well. It identifies properly in voice which originates remotely in the IRLP
Node. That IRLP Node computer system is
being relocated back to the new home of John VE3IAO, in Almonte. Unfortunately, due to network problems, the
IRLP function has been working only outbound since June. This was when the system was moved from
John's previous home in Carp, to the home of Steve Mayne VE3LWX, near
Franktown. John's new high-speed
service should return the IRLP function to normal.</p>

<p>Our recent work on the repeaters
and IRLP Node has resulted in complete documentation, instruction manuals on
all systems, and an upcoming PowerPoint presentation in the new year.</p>

<p><b><u>D-Star</u></b></p>

<p>Rick VE3CVG reported that the
recent software update for the gateway was installed and is working fine with
23 users registered. Manfred VA3WK
mentioned that there is a new kit available to attach to an existing radio to
enable operation on DSTAR. Rick
mentioned that DSTAR is growing across Canada, but is slower in growth than
expected in Ottawa.</p>

<p><b><u>OLD BUSINESS</u></b></p>

<p><b><u>Balloon Project</u></b></p>

<p>Balloon Project Chair Graham
VE3BYT corrected some minor errors in the references to the project in the
President's Report. The recent Perth
balloon altitude record attempt was made by the Parents' Association of the
Perth Montessori School. The communications
were provided by the North Lanark ARES Club. For our own balloon launch planned for April, the focus will be on
instrumentation and telemetry. Dale
VE3XZT has acquired an ATV transmitter and a GPS suitable for flight. Wayne VE3CZO has agreed to provide a
broadcast of the ATV video on the VE3ATV television repeater. Graham described the flight path of the
Perth launch and pointed out that we would not be focusing on altitude or
distance, but rather on the measurements and real-time TV pictures. The budget has not yet been determined, but
will require the purchase of the balloon and the helium required for the
flight.</p>


<p><b><u>Beacon Report</u></b></p>


<p>Beacon Project Chair Doug VE3XK
described the accident during the erection of the beacon antennas. The upper strut got loose in the U-bolt and
the antenna mast rotated, bringing the array down into a soft landing in a pile
of snow. The only damage to the antenna
array was a failed U-bolt and a failed coupling between the 10 ft. mast
sections. Upon testing of the contents
of the enclosure before re-erection, Doug discovered that the MFJ-4115 power
supply was inoperable. All other
contents tested OK on the bench.</p>


<p>Since that power supply was
Doug's personal unit and not intended as a permanent part of the beacon project,
it was decided that a suitable power supply be acquired and installed. An Astron SS-18 power supply was ordered for
delivery in two days. As with other
equipment in the enclosure the SS-18 is designed for -10&deg; C to 50&deg;
C operation and has a thermally controlled fan which does not run most
of the time. </p>


<p>The array should be re-mounted on
the tower this week and the enclosure mounted two or three days later, after
testing under normal load. </p>


<p><b><u>Election</u></b></p>


<p>With no candidates for
Vice-President and Treasurer, both incumbents were willing to serve another
two-year term. The members present
voted their approval by applause.</p>


<p><b><u>Adjournment</u></b></p>


<p>Dale VE3XZT moved that the
meeting be adjourned.</p>


<p><b><u>Christmas Party </u></b></p>

<p>The Christmas Party followed,
with door prizes and refreshments provided by the club.</p>


<p>Barney Baker - VA3BGB<br>
Secretary</p>
