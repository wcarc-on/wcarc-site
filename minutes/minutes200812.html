<p>In the absence of President Al
VO1NO, Vice President Doug VE3XK called the meeting to order at 19h40 and
requested guests, then all members to introduce themselves.</p>

<p>Doug then circulated the proposed
agenda and asked for any additions or deletions - of which there were none.</p>

<b><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-fareast-font-family:
"Times New Roman";mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;
mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'><br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</span></u></b>

<p><b><u>Reports</u></b></p>


<p>Al VO1NO/VE3 provided a written
Annual Presidents Report, which Doug circulated.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Doug reviewed each item with the members. He requested that the
report be placed on the website. Rick VE3CVG agreed that he would place it in
the historical section.</p>


<p>Treasurer Ken VE3KA reported that
the bank balance was $459.00.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
additional $300.00 in member's dues was received during this meeting. Ken
mentioned that he will provide a year end report at the next meeting. He is
pursuing a change of banks to escape the $4/mo service charges presently
charged by Royal Bank on chequing accounts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>He has found that most banks have adopted similar charges. The PC bank
service does not provide chequing. Bank of Montreal (BMO) provides a Community
Account with a moderate per-cheque charge, and our account will probably be
moved to the local BMO branch at Signature Centre, Kanata</p>


<p>Secretary Barney VA3BGB moved
that the minutes of the November 4, 2008 meeting be accepted as published. Rick
VE3CVG seconded the motion - it was passed. </p>

<p>Rick mentioned that the corrected
minutes for the October 7, 2008 meeting had not been approved. Barney asked
that the members review those minutes for approval at the next meeting.</p>

<p>Doug VE3XK suggested that the
minutes be reviewed initially by the executive, prior to submission to the
webmaster for publishing on the website.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He also suggested that the small WCARC logo should be added to the top of
subsequent minutes.</p>

<p><b><u>Webmaster</u></b></p>

<p>Webmaster Rick VE3CVG stated that
the web site is operational and all submissions have been posted.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He is continuing his efforts toward the
transfer of the club's website domain name from Rene VA3XK, to himself.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rick is working with Manfred to accomplish
this transfer.</p>

<p><b><u>Repeaters</u></b></p>

<p>Repeater Committee Chair Dale
VE3XZT mentioned that work on the repeaters is now completed.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A new CW identification chip, programmed
with the club callsign VE3WCC/R,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>has
been installed in the 2M repeater and the repeater tested OK.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The repeater will be re-installed this week
at the Franktown tower site by Phil VE3CIQ.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The 70CM repeater is working well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It identifies properly in voice which originates remotely in the IRLP
Node.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That IRLP Node computer system is
being relocated back to the new home of John VE3IAO, in Almonte.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, due to network problems, the
IRLP function has been working only outbound since June.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This was when the system was moved from
John's previous home in Carp, to the home of Steve Mayne VE3LWX, near
Franktown.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>John's new high-speed
service should return the IRLP function to normal.</p>

<p>Our recent work on the repeaters
and IRLP Node has resulted in complete documentation, instruction manuals on
all systems, and an upcoming PowerPoint presentation in the new year.</p>

<p><b><u>D-Star</u></b></p>

<p>Rick VE3CVG reported that the
recent software update for the gateway was installed and is working fine with
23 users registered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Manfred VA3WK
mentioned that there is a new kit available to attach to an existing radio to
enable operation on DSTAR.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rick
mentioned that DSTAR is growing across Canada, but is slower in growth than
expected in Ottawa.</p>

<p><b><u>OLD BUSINESS</u></b></p>

<p><b><u>Balloon Project</u></b></p>

<p>Balloon Project Chair Graham
VE3BYT corrected some minor errors in the references to the project in the
President's Report.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The recent Perth
balloon altitude record attempt was made by the Parents' Association of the
Perth Montessori School.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The communications
were provided by the North Lanark ARES Club.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>For our own balloon launch planned for April, the focus will be on
instrumentation and telemetry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Dale
VE3XZT has acquired an ATV transmitter and a GPS suitable for flight.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Wayne VE3CZO has agreed to provide a
broadcast of the ATV video on the VE3ATV television repeater.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Graham described the flight path of the
Perth launch and pointed out that we would not be focusing on altitude or
distance, but rather on the measurements and real-time TV pictures.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The budget has not yet been determined, but
will require the purchase of the balloon and the helium required for the
flight.</p>


<p><b><u>Beacon Report</u></b></p>


<p>Beacon Project Chair Doug VE3XK
described the accident during the erection of the beacon antennas.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The upper strut got loose in the U-bolt and
the antenna mast rotated, bringing the array down into a soft landing in a pile
of snow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The only damage to the antenna
array was a failed U-bolt and a failed coupling between the 10 ft. mast
sections.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon testing of the contents
of the enclosure before re-erection, Doug discovered that the MFJ-4115 power
supply was inoperable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All other
contents tested OK on the bench.</p>


<p>Since that power supply was
Doug's personal unit and not intended as a permanent part of the beacon project,
it was decided that a suitable power supply be acquired and installed.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>An Astron SS-18 power supply was ordered for
delivery in two days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As with other
equipment in the enclosure the SS-18 is designed for -10<span style='font-family:
"Old English Text MT"'>&deg; </span>C to 50<span style='font-family:"Old English Text MT"'>&deg;
</span>C operation and has a thermally controlled fan which does not run most
of the time. </p>


<p>The array should be re-mounted on
the tower this week and the enclosure mounted two or three days later, after
testing under normal load. </p>


<p><b><u>Election</u></b></p>


<p>With no candidates for
Vice-President and Treasurer, both incumbents were willing to serve another
two-year term.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The members present
voted their approval by applause.</p>


<p><b><u>Adjournment</u></b></p>


<p>Dale VE3XZT moved that the
meeting be adjourned.</p>


<p><b><u>Christmas Party </u></b></p>

<p>The Christmas Party followed,
with door prizes and refreshments provided by the club.</p>


<p>Barney Baker - VA3BGB</p>

<p>Secretary</p>
