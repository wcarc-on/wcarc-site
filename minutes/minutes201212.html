<STRONG>Treasurer's Report:</STRONG> <BR>
   Treasurer Ken Asmus (VA3KA) reported that the current bank balance was $642.38. The renewal of insurance through Radio Amateurs of Canada, typically about $283, was the only outsatnding 
expense. This bill had not yet been received, so the club will close the year with a reasonable balance. He noted that membership renewals will be due in January. Ken also informed 
members that he would not stand for re-election. The President, Al Penny (VO1NO) thanked Ken for his excellent contribution to the club as Treasurer over more than a decade.</p>

  General Reports and Announcements:</STRONG><br>
  <BR>
  <strong>Beacons</strong><BR>
  Doug Leach (VE3XK) reported that the WCARC beacons (6m, 2m, 1 1/4m, 70cm) continue to operate nominally. Rick Bandla (VE3CVG) reported that he had obtained kits for beacons at 
903.360MHz and 1296.060MHz and was now completing the assembly. He plans to locate the beacons at a central location in Ottawa.<BR><BR>
  <strong>D-STAR<br>
</strong>Rick Bandla (VE3CVG) reported that the Ottawa Amateur Radio Digital Group had obtained access to an underused software reflector, XRF018, located in Montreal and administered by 
Brent (VE3BFW), who is a member of OARDG. This new arrangement is expected to enhance Ottawa area D-STAR communications.<br><br>
<strong>Grid Expedition</strong>:<br>
Al (VO1NO) reported that the scores for the ARRL VHF QSO Party held in mid June 2012 have now been posted. VE3WCC operated by the club did very well, scoring more than double its previous 
high. It was not only the highest score in its class but the highest score in Canada, in the top 4 in the ARRL Central Region and 20th highest score overall. He expressed some 
surprise at the reductions from our even higher claimed score and participants in the past contest discussed how to reduce errors that led to the reductions, with the objective of 
scoring event higher next year.
