### President's Report
- We had a Club table at the Carp Hamfest. We used the Club projector and had posters showing pictures and Club information. As a result, one new member joined the Club during the event.

### Presentation
Dennis Whalen (KC3EJA) - Parks On The Air (POTA).

### Old Business
- Karen provided pictures of the beacon move to Lee Boltwood, the owner of our former beacon site. This was to highlight her contribution to the Club operations. She was very appreciative of that. She was also very interested in the new beacon location.
- 902/1296 Beacons. Bert will contact Ying (VA3YH) again to see whether the beacons can be recovered from the YMCA site soon. We could re-install the beacons at our main beacon site, on a mast that is in reserve on location. The DC supply would come from our existing beacon box.

### New Business
- Charles (VA3CPY): We must find a 432 antenna. Bert (VE2ZAZ) informed the members that Ken (VA3KA), a Club member, will soon be taking down his ham radio antenna farm. Bert will contact Ken to find out whether he has one UHF long boom antenna to sell. Otherwise we will have to purchase one. Lawrence (VA3IQ) is planning an antenna purchase from M2 Antennas. We could combine the shipping with his order and save money.
- Lawrence (VA3IQ) is proposing a WCARC name tag group purchase. Dominion Rubber Stamp & Engraving will make them. He will get a quote on badges and look for interested members at the next meeting. The cost will be approximately $10 ea.
