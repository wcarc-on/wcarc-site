### Treasurer's Report

- Collection of 2021 membership dues: It can be done through an Alterna online banking account. The newly elected Treasurer will have to open the account. Two Club officer signatures will be required.

### Vice President's Report

- Jeremy received a check from the city of Ottawa, a refund for one meeting room rental. He will deposit it soon to our bank account at an Alterna branch.
- The next meeting will be the annual general meeting. Two Officer positions will be up for election: Vice President and Treasurer. The current Officers in these positions have announced that they would not run again for their respective positions. The meeting will also feature a Show-And-Tell session, so members will be invited to show some of their ongoing projects or newly acquired products.

### President's Report

- In preparation for the upcoming December Officer election, Charles (VA3CPY) once again promoted the importance of getting involved on the executive committee, especially to those with basic accounting skills who could fill the treasurer's position.
- Charles asked for input from members on how the next meeting—which is normally also our Christmas party—would unfold, considering the online nature of our meetings. A few members suggested that a show-and-tell can be very popular, particularly if the objects shown are unknown, and members have to guess what they are.
- Considering the current state of the pandemic, the members should expect to continue meeting online for the first half of 2021.
