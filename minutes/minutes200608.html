<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;The meeting convened at
7:30 at Sobey's in Kanata.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Arial'>Tom, VA3NFA, determined that we
had no new guests present.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Arial'>Rick, VE3CVG, indicated that the
web site is up to date and that the 903 MHz beacon is working. Rick announced that he and Ken, VA3KA, would
be working on two personal projects - 902 band FM repeaters, and implementation
of the ICOM D-Star digital system.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Arial'>Ken reported that the finances
are in good shape and the domain name is paid for the year.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Arial'>Graham, VE3BYT, had nothing to
report.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Arial'>Tom noted that several members
had worked AL, VO1NO, on the Magdalen Islands. Rick reminded us about the microwave contest the following weekend.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Arial'>There was no new business.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Arial'>Regarding 902 band repeaters,
Rick reported that he and Ken have acquired a number of surplus commercial
mobile and HT radios, and that they will be installing a repeater in the east
area and one in the west that will be linked together. At present equipment for a 25 MHz Tx/Rx
separation is available at reasonable prices. Eventually a 12 MHz split may be viable. It is planned to link these new repeaters to the 144 and 440 band
repeaters as well.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Arial'>Rick reported that he and Ken
have applied for a $16,000 Seniors Grant to assist them with implementing the
D-Star system. Rick says that D-Star
uses the same protocol as the AOR modules. They are asking ICOM to supply two 1.2 GHz repeaters and the group will
put up 144 and 440 MHz digital systems as well. D-<br>
Star installations are proceeding in a number of cities, including Calgary,
Vancouver, Victoria and Montreal. The
'group' may pass the hat to area clubs to assist with the project.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Arial'>The club plans to put up the 222
MHz repeater, and beacons for the 144, 222 and 440 MHz bands as soon as it can
be done. Rick indicated that his
involvement with these would be on the back burner for the foreseeable future.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Arial'>Doug, VE3XK, showed and described
his stripped down Tellurometer for 10 GHz, with power supply and 12 volt power
access. Doug indicated that Ray, VE3FN,
would be happy to have help and participation on this band. Ray is doing narrow-band work on 10 GHz.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Arial'>Steve, VA3SAX, showed his 40M.
regenerative receiver - which is yet to be fully functional. Rick and others made suggestions for the
project. Rick described 'Dead Bug' and
'Manhattan Style' (islands above a ground plane) construction methods.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Arial'>The Carp Fleamarket is on
September 2.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Arial'>The next meeting will be on <span
