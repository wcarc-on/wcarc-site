<H2>Minutes - Meeting of August 2, 2005</H2>
<P>The meeting was held in the Kanata Room at Sobey's in Kanata.</P>
<P>The following members and guests were present (in random order):
<LI>Doug Leach VE3XK FN15wg 
<LI>Les McCready  VA3BZQ
<LI>Barney Baker VA3BGB FN25ai
<LI>Rick Bandla  VE3CVG  V.Pres/Webmaster
<LI>Bob Clermont VE3AKV
<LI>Graham Ide VE3BYT FN25ch Secy 
<LI>Justin Schmidt-Clever VE3QYR guest
</P>

<P>Rick, VE3CVG, mentioned that he has booked the Kanata Room for 
WCARC meetings for September and October.</P>

<P>Justin, VE3QYR, came to visit to see how (if) the group ticked.  He is 
interested in QRP and has a kit for a 5 watt CW transceiver.  The 
group had some discussion of building kits, kits that did not work, and 
equipment blowing or failing the smoke test by actually producing 
smoke.</P>

<P>Rick reported that he had had contacts on 40 and 20 meters with Ken, 
VA3KA, and others on his recent trip to Edmonton by car.</P>

<P>It was noted that Ray, VE3FN, had a contact with Hamilton on 3 cm - 
10 GHz.  Pretty neat!.  Ray will be trying Woodstock soon.  The group 
talked about the joys and hazards of mountaintopping - the major 
difficulty on some sites being Park Wardens or security types.</P>

<P>Graham described a bug zapper in the form of a badminton racquet, 
available at Giant Tiger at low cost - perfect for generating 
interference or for electrocuting your cat.  There is potential here for 
building your very own Taser.</P>

<P>It was noted by Bob, VE3AKV, an amateur radio examiner, that very 
few people are taking the examinations these days.  They are mostly 
older people going from Basic to Advanced.  Also noted that Kieran, 
VA3KS, is no longer an examiner.</P>

<P>There was a discussion of how your TNC should now be programmed 
for APRS, but it was noted that not all areas have made the change to 
the new format.  Following this inspiration, the group adjourned to the 
parking lot to test with Doug's, VE3XK, mobile TinyTrak.</P>

<P>The next meeting will be on September 6, 2005</P>

<P>Graham Ide VE3BYT Secretary.</P><BR>
