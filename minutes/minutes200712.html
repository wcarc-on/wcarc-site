<p>Tom, VA3NFA, welcomed everyone,
especially Barrie, VE3BSB, Adam, VE3ZXK, and Dave, VE3AAQ. Dave was congratulated
on his election as President of Radio Amateurs of Canada beginning in January
2008. </p>

<p>Tom gave an interesting recap of
the events over the past year. The club
has done quite a number of interesting and useful projects and has enjoyed many
informative presentations at meetings over 2007. See the minutes of meetings for more information.</p>

<p>Rick, VE3CVG, indicated that the
902 band beacon is working OK, near its planned frequency of 903.370 MHz. The D-STAR system is working OK with 16-17
users. Users can connect to any D-STAR
system in the world.</p>

<p>The WCARC web site has had
thousands of hits. At present the site
is charged to Rick's account at Mondenet, around $100 per year.</p>

<p>Graham, VE3BYT, reported that the
minutes for the year to date are on the web site.</p>

<p>Ken, VA3KA, said that we have 27
members paid to date for 2007. Finances
are in good order. At the meeting the
club donated $101 to the OARDG (the Ottawa Amateur Radio Digital Group).</p>

<p>Tom informed the members that he
had been advised we should have an uneven number of directors so we would be
unlikely to have tie votes on motions. Tom moved that we add a Director-at-large, seconded by Dale,
VE3XZT. There was a proposed amendment
to the motion - that the new director be the immediate past-president; this was
later withdrawn. The original motion
passed unanimously.</p>

<p>The election was held for
officers for 2008:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For President - Al Penney, VO1NO - Nominated by Ken, seconded by Graham.</li>
  <li>For Vice President - Doug Leach, VE3XK - Nominated by Rick, seconded by Al.</li>
  <li>For Treasurer - Ken Asmus, VA3KA - Nominated by Al, seconded by Graham.</li>
  <li>For Secretary - Barney Baker, VA3BGB - Nominated by Rick, seconded by Al.</li>
  <li>For new Director - Dale Hennigar, VE3XZT - Nominated by Ken, seconded by John, VE3IAO.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these candidates were elected by acclamation and with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Rick, VE3CVG, will continue as WebMaster. Ken has been treasurer since 2000, and will continue. Ken noted that I (Graham, VE3BYT) have been
secretary since June, 2000. (I am surprised it has been that long).</p>

<p>Tom expressed thanks to the 2007
executive on behalf of the members, and offered congratulations to the new
executive for 2008. Tom noted that the
club web site is very comprehensive, useful and interesting - 'Good job, Rick'.</p>

<p>Rick and Tom will forward to the
new executive all offers they have received for speakers, tours, and other
activities.</p>

<p>Dave Goodwin, VE3AAQ, area
Regional Director of Radio Amateurs of Canada, provided a few notes on the
recent World Radio Conference. Canadian
Amateurs will have an allocation at 137 kHz when this is approved for use by
Industry Canada. 7.200 - 7.300 MHz will
continue to be shared with broadcasting. RAC will participate in preparatory meetings for WRC 2011, beginning in
2008.</p>

<p>Bill, W4TAA/VE3, is thinking of
participating in a DXpedition to Sable Island. If he goes, he will activate the 6 Metre band there. Bill has acquired a 6 M. beacon and is
considering running it at times when he is not on the air himself. Bill will defer this project until the new
year.</p>

<p>Adam, VE3ZXK, mentioned that he
had access to some programmable 440 equipment and that he would bring some to a
future meeting.</p>

<p>Members drew numbers for the
order in which they could choose the attendance prizes that were arranged for
by Rick. There were lots of neat items
and everyone came away with something useful.</p>

<p>Coffee and juice and a variety of
snacks were laid out, including delicious nuts provided by Doug, VE3XK. Everyone enjoyed Eyeball QSOs until these
were all consumed. The last meeting of
the year was adjourned with everyone's appetite for discussion and goodies well
satisfied.</p>

<p>The next meeting will be on Wednesday, January 2, 2008. Note that this is one day later than the
usual meeting date, in view of New Year's Day being on the first Tuesday of the
month.</p>

<p>Graham Ide VE3BYT<br>
Secretary.</p>

<p>Personal note: I have enjoyed being Secretary for the past
few years. This was not really an
onerous job for me as Ken has kept the club membership records and Rick
maintains the web site. Bon voyage,
Barney.</p>
