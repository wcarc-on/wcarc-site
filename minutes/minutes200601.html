<P>Tom, VA3NFA, called for introductions around the room.&nbsp; Robin Webb, 
VE3UIX, attended as a guest.<BR>Ken, VA3KA, had sent his regrets and was not 
present. </P>
<P>Rick, VE3CVG, reported that the 903 MHz beacon, installed before Christmas, 
was causing interference to commercial equipment on the site.&nbsp; It is to be 
moved to another site at St. Laurent and Montreal Road.<BR>Doug, VE3XK,&nbsp; 
indicated that he had a tunable cavity for 900 MHz. </P>
<P>Brad, VE3BSM, reported on APRS in the area.&nbsp; VE3DVQ at Lavant had died, 
but Brad was able to bring it back.&nbsp; Digipeaters at Kingston and Belleville 
have been upgraded. </P>
<P>Al Penney, VO1NO, will organize the club's Field Day activities if there is 
enough interest.&nbsp; It's possible we could participate with the Perth/Lanark 
ARES Group.&nbsp; Al will investigate this. </P>
<P>Rick will update the WCARC web site and add to the club history that he has 
been compiling.&nbsp; Brad offered to do a page on APRS and Area 
Digipeaters.&nbsp; Tom said that he would prepare an article on APRS and beacons 
for publication in The Canadian Amateur. </P>
<P>Al Penney gave an extensive and most interesting illustrated talk on RADAR, 
Electronic Countermeasures and related subjects.&nbsp; He pointed out that the 
Russians jammed Japanese signals in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905.&nbsp; 
Interception equipment was used in World War I, generally in the range of 2500 
to 25000 Meters wavelength.&nbsp; Of course there was extensive use of 
monitoring and countermeasures in the Second World War.&nbsp; One man, Dr. R. V. Jones, discovered the new German electronic 
navigation systems and jammed them, thereby winning the "Battle of the 
Beams".</FONT> </P>
<P>Al mentioned several books on the subject -<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; - The Most Secret 
War (in the US, The Wizard War) - R.V. Jones<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; - The Secret War - 
BBC<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Instruments of Darkness - Price<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Night 
Fighters - Gunston </P>
<P>The next meeting will be on February 7, 2006 </P>
