<p>This meeting was basically a
ragchew session.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Steve, VA3SAX, brought our
attention to a Microwave Software-Defined Radio (UWSDR) project on the
Internet. Check out this URL:
<a
href="http://uwsdr.berlios.de/index.html">http://uwsdr.berlios.de/index.html</a>.
From the web site it's difficult to see how much progress has been made on the
VHF, UHF and higher frequency front ends. This will bear watching.</p>

<p>The contest in mid-September was
noted. There was some discussion of a
possible DXpedition for that along the Bissett Creek Road.</p>

<p>Dean, VA3CDD, showed around some
sample boards for Smart Meters using the 902 and 2400 MHz bands.</p>

<p>Graham, VE3BYT, noted that the
new hardware/farm equipment store (TSE) in Smiths Falls has available a variety
of useful welding and other utility gases.</p>

<p>It was noted that in late June
there was a Sporadic E opening on 6 Meters to all of Europe, that later opened
to the west into the Pacific. Also
noted was the contest for 50 and 144 MHz bands on July 21 and 22.</p>

<p>Al, VO1NO, mentioned a DXpedition
for the 28 and 29 of July to Elder Island (Bonne Portage) off Nova Scotia. Al also outlined the search for Amelia
Earhart in the South Pacific. This and
other interesting investigations are described on <a href="http://www.tighar.org/">www.tighar.org/</a> -
The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery.</p>

<p>The next meeting will be on August 7, 2007.</p>

<p>Graham Ide VE3BYT&nbsp;<br>
Secretary.</p>
