### Old Business

- 902/1296 MHz Beacons: The beacons are still non-operational. Bert (VE2ZAZ) will contact Phil Lytle (VE3HOA) again to get an update on their attempt to organize a visit to the YMCA roof to re-activate or recover the beacons, depending on the Club's decision regarding beacon relocation.
- Lawrence (VA3IQ): The Club's interest in providing advice on emergency communications to a local emergency preparedness committee. Lawrence reached out to the president of the emergency preparedness committee. He has not heard back from him. A discussion on that matter between the Club Officers will take place when we know more. The board will report back to the members at a future meeting.

### New Business

- In-person meetings: Lawrence (VA3IQ) will start to search for a low-cost location for our meetings. Members are asked to come up with suggestions of venues. An informal discussion followed.
- Club participation at the OARC Carp hamfest (scheduled September 9th 2023): Bert (VE2ZAZ) will make the table reservation.

### Show and tell

- Bert (VE2ZAZ) talked about an RCS-10 coaxial switch smart controller he designed and built. It works great with an Icom IC-7300, or with any Icom HF radio equipped with a physical "Remote" CI-V jack.
- Clayton (VE3IRR) showed a simple antenna installation for receiving weather balloon radiosonde beacons.
- A few participants tried to place calls on the the Hamshack Hotline VoIP network.
- Mike (VA3TEC) showed an Intel N95 dual-core mini-computer, which is available on Amazon for around $225. This PC beats the Raspberry Pi units in features and performance.
