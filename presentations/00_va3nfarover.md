title: 50Mhz sprint October 23, 2004 - VA3NFA/VE3XZT Rover
---

Dale, VE3XZT, and I (VA3NFA) had a BLAST during this contest!

We operated as a Rover and activated FN25, FN15, FN14 and FN24 during the short 4 hour contest. We were
able to work many of the local "big guns" and even
work some DX during the short E's that surprised us during the contest.

Here is a map of our route:

We found an EXCELLENT operating position in FN14, at
the site of an old Bell tower (ed note: Numogate?) that is no longer used. Also, Brad, VE3BSM, found a great location  for us to operate from FN24. Thanks Brad!

Here are our "unofficial" results:

* From FN25 - 6 QSO's / Grids: FN15, FN25
* From FN15 - 4 QSO's / Grids: FN15, FN25
* From FN14 - 6 QSO's / Grids: EL96, EM60, EM70, FN15, FN24, FN25
* From FN24 - 6 QSO's / Grids: EM60, FN15, FN24, FN25
* Total QSO's: 22 / Total Grids: 14
* Claimed Score: 308

We drove a little over 230Kms to work these grids,
thus we only had about 20 minutes "parked" at each
location.

Our station was a FT-857 running at about 75 watts.
While mobile we used a 6m hamstick on the van, and
while parked we setup a Par Omni Loop on a 10' mast
supported with a small tripod. We drank Tim Horton's
coffee and had a variety of Timbits.

As this contest is "rule light" we used APRS and 70cm
to setup scheds before and during the contest.

Here is a pic of the happy rovers and setup:

Thanks again for all the contacts. I think Dale and I
have caught the "rover bug"!!!

Hmmmmm... "VA3NFA Psycho Rover" for the June VHF
Contest......
