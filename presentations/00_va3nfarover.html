<H2>50Mhz sprint 23 October, 2004 - VA3NFA/VE3XZT Rover</H2>

<P>Dale, VE3XZT, and I (VA3NFA) had a BLAST during this contest!</P>
<P>We operated as a Rover and activated FN25, FN15, FN14 and FN24 during the short 4 hour contest. We were
able to work many of the local &quot;big guns&quot; and even
work some DX during the short E's that surprised us during the contest.</P>
<P>Here is a map of our route: </P>

<P>We found an EXCELLENT operating position in FN14, at
the site of an old Bell tower (ed note: Numagate?) that is no longer used. Also, Brad, VE3BSM, found a great location  for us to operate from FN24. Thanks Brad!</P>
<P>Here are our &quot;unofficial&quot; results:
<li>From FN25 - 6 QSO's / Grids: FN15, FN25
<li>From FN15 - 4 QSO's / Grids: FN15, FN25
<li>From FN14 - 6 QSO's / Grids: EL96, EM60, EM70, FN15, FN24, FN25
<li>From FN24 - 6 QSO's / Grids: EM60, FN15, FN24, FN25
<li>Total QSO's: 22 / Total Grids: 14
<li>Claimed Score: 308</P>
<P>We drove a little over 230Kms to work these grids,
thus we only had about 20 minutes &quot;parked&quot; at each
location.</P>
<P>Our station was a FT-857 running at about 75 watts.
While mobile we used a 6m hamstick on the van, and
while parked we setup a Par Omni Loop on a 10' mast
supported with a small tripod. We drank Tim Horton's
coffee and had a variety of Timbits.</P>
<P>As this contest is &quot;rule light&quot; we used APRS and 70cm
to setup scheds before and during the contest.</P>
<P>Here is a pic of the happy rovers and setup:</P>

<P>Thanks again for all the contacts. I think Dale and I
have caught the &quot;rover bug&quot;!!!</P>
<P>Hmmmmm... &quot;VA3NFA Psycho Rover&quot; for the June VHF
Contest......</P>
