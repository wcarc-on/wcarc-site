<H2>Presentation on Propagation</H2>
<li>By: Doug Leach (VE3XK)
<li>To: West Carleton Amateur Radio Club
<li>On: November 7, 2012
<br><br>
Doug's talk was based on a presentation by Paul Herrman (N0NBH) but highly annotated by himself, based 
on extensive research from the listed references. This talk stimulated considerable discussion from 
the WCARC members that were present.
<br><br>
Paul Herrman's main web site is <A href="http://www.hamqsl.com">http://www.hamqsl.com</a>
<br><br>
The link for Paul's presentatiom is <A href="http://www.hamqsl.com/Understanding%20Propagation.pdf">http://www.hamqsl.com/Understanding%20Propagation.pdf</a>
<br><br>
The link for the associated glossary is <A href="http://www.hamqsl.com/Glossary.pdf">http://www.hamqsl.com/Glossary.pdf</a>
<br><br>
One particular chart was difficult to see in the presentation. This link produces a B&W table of all the values and interpretation for the solar data panel. See <A href="http://www.hamqsl.com/shortcut.html">http://www.hamqsl.com/shortcut.html</a>
<br><br>
Doug has combined his additional remarks, plus his References, into a single page. See <a href= "./ve3xk_supp_20121107.pdf"> ve3xk_supplement_to_understanding_propagation.pdf</a>
<br><br>

<p>
Doug has fed back his comments and suggestions to Paul and notes that, from looking at the N0NBH web site, Paul is working on another banner using the 304A information. 
Which is in line with Doug's comments about the need to replace SFI. Although he has left 
the "Understanding" talk and "Glossary" for download, Paul has restructured the web site version with all the prop 
pages broken out so you don't have to wade through all of them.
