title: Presentation on Propagation

By: Doug Leach (VE3XK)  
Date: November 7, 2012

Doug's talk was based on a presentation by Paul Herrman (N0NBH) but highly annotated by himself, based
on extensive research from the listed references. This talk stimulated considerable discussion from
the WCARC members that were present.

Paul Herrman's main web site is [http://www.hamqsl.com](http://www.hamqsl.com)

The link for Paul's presentation is [http://www.hamqsl.com/Understanding%20Propagation.pdf](http://www.hamqsl.com/Understanding%20Propagation.pdf)

The link for the associated glossary is [http://www.hamqsl.com/Glossary.pdf](http://www.hamqsl.com/Glossary.pdf)

One particular chart was difficult to see in the presentation.
This link produces a B&W table of all the values and interpretation for the solar data panel.

Doug has posted his [additional remarks and references](ve3xk_supp_20121107.pdf).

Doug has fed back his comments and suggestions to Paul and notes that, from looking at the N0NBH web site, Paul is working on another banner using the 304A information.
Which is in line with Doug's comments about the need to replace SFI. Although he has left
the "Understanding" talk and "Glossary" for download, Paul has restructured the web site version with all the prop
pages broken out so you don't have to wade through all of them.
