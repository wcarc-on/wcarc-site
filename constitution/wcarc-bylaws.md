1. Membership:
    1. Membership is open to radio amateurs, and to individuals who are
engaged in studies leading to a Certificate of Proficiency in Amateur Radio.
Membership includes all Club privileges as well as rights to vote on expenditures
or elections for Club officers, and to hold a Club office except as noted in Bylaw 3.
Applications for membership shall be submitted with dues for the current year
as applicable, at a general meeting. Because of the importance of e-mail
communication to Club business, members must provide the Club with an e-mail
address for communication, and must advise promptly of any address change.
Membership may be withdrawn by majority vote as defined in Bylaw 2 at a
general meeting.
    2. Life membership, free of annual dues or assessments, may be granted to
major benefactors of the club. Candidates for nomination shall be approved by
majority vote of the officers. Two weeks in advance of the next monthly general
meeting, notice of the successful nominee name(s) and the intent to hold a vote
on the matter shall be sent to the club members. Life members count in the
membership total and for the purposes of calculating a quorum.
2. Meetings and Voting: General Meetings shall be held monthly as advised by
the President unless cancelled or rescheduled by the President and the members
notified in advance. The Club's Annual General Meeting shall be part of the
December general meeting. The election of officers shall be held at the Annual
General Meeting, or at the first subsequent general meeting for which at least two
weeks notice of the election has been provided to the members. Special Meetings
shall be called by the President, at the written request of any five Club members.
Notices of Special Meetings shall be sent to all members, along with a description
of the business to be transacted, so that they arrive not less than two days before
the meeting. Only such business as designated shall be transacted.  An e-mail
notice sent to the member's e-mail address on record with the Club is an
acceptable means of communication for a notice of meeting other than a regularly
scheduled general meeting. All votes or elections shall require a quorum of five
members to be present. An individual who has not paid the Club dues and
assessments for the current year does not count in the membership total for the
purposes of calculating a quorum and cannot vote on any matter.
