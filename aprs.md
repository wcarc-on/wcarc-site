## Digipeaters

Our club operates the VE3DVQ digipeater, located near Lavant. It is presently
off the air pending repairs. Inquiries should be directed to Barrie Crampton (VE3BSB).

From 2005 to 2015, the club operated the VE3WCC-1 digipeater located in Nepean.
After losing access to the tower site, the club donated the remaining equipment
to the Ottawa Amateur Radio Club, which plans to install a digipeater at Camp
Fortune, operating under a new call sign.
