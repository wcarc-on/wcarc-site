## Digipeaters

From 2005 to 2015, the club operated the VE3WCC-1 digipeater located in Nepean.
After losing access to the tower site, the club donated the remaining equipment
to the Ottawa Amateur Radio Club, which operates the digipeater from the CFRA transmitter site South of Manotick as VE3OCR-4.

The club formerly operated the VE3DVQ digipeater, located near Lavant. It is now
owned by Lanark & North Leeds ARES.
