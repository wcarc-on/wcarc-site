## Digipeaters

Throughout 2005 Brad VE3BSM was on a mission to upgrade the path
protocol for all local users of APRS to the new WIDEn-N protocol which
is designed to minimize collisions and improve co-existence of stations
and digis. We now have near 100% compliance in eastern Ontario.

With the demise of VE3MPC digi, the Ottawa area was without a suitable
digipeater for APRS. In the fall of 2005 Brad obtained approval and financial support from WCARC to upgrade the local digipeaters. WCARC agreed to sponsor a new major digi for the Ottawa area and also to help with repairs of several nearby digi's.

VE3WCC-1 digi was installed in November 2005, in central Ottawa, with the coordinated effort of Brad VE3BSM, Phil VE3CIQ, and Shawn VE3HXP.

In addition, the VE3DVQ digi located near Lavant was resurrected  to provide coverage to the deep west.

Thanks to the combined cooperation of the other wide-area digi owners, we now enjoy 2-hop APRS coverage throughout almost all of Eastern Ontario.

The next goal is to attempt to find suitable sites for digipeaters in the northwest area of the Ottawa Valley and also the deep east of Ottawa between Cumberland and Alfred.
