The West Carleton Amateur Radio Club was formed back in the early 1970's, probably as a spin-off of the OARC for members in the deep west of Ottawa who could not make the regular OARC meetings because of the travel distance.

Meetings were first held in the Bells Corners library building and a little later in the Tennis Club building in Lynwood Village.  George Acton VA3QH was president but did not like the Tennis Club location as it was too close to the power lines and it gave him headaches. He arranged for space for the club at Computing Devices (CDC) in Bells Corners.

Hap Chafe VE3MW was involved with the club back in the days after the library and he recounts "The club's main interest and activity was the annual Field Day operation, set up in a different locale each year. I remember one year we worked one of the RS satellites with one of the gang manually steering a ten element 2 metre beam mounted on a pole about 5 feet high and getting the info for the azimuth shouted through the tent wall.  '5 right ... another 5 right ... hold it ... another 5 right ... up a bit'. Very high tech but it worked!"

Members included Hap Chafe VE3MW, Ralph Cameron VE3BBM, Barrie Crampton VE3BSB, John Brummel, Ivan Jensen VE3AKL, Joyce Jensen, George Acton VA3QH (SK), and Brian Crook VE3CRG, who was the high speed CW operator.

At this point the original WCARC faded.

Based on memories of Gord Dey (VE3PSP), in about 1985, Kieran Shepherd (VA3KS) and Gord were meeting in a coffee shop, and called themselves a "radio fraternity" so they could use the initials "RF" in the name. There might still be a link on the Ottawa freenet website (www.ncf.ca) to that group. Here's what the freenet link said:

> WEST CARLETON NORTH LANARK RADIO FRATERNITY (WCNLRF)
>
> The WCNLRF features irregular weekly meetings, equipment
> exchanges, amateur radio training for XYLs.  We operate two UHF
> repeaters (VE3GSD on 444.45+ and VE3LVG on 444.85+) as well as a
> packet board, node and DX cluster(VE3OSQ.#EONT.CAN.NA) on 144.97.
>
> Meetings are usually held at MrMUGS on Hazeldean Road, 0700-0730.
> Contact Gord VE3PPE and Kieran VE3OSQ for more information.
> Junior members are welcome.

Peter Jago, the last remaining member of WCARC, approached WCNLRF and asked if they'd like to take over the West Carleton Amateur Radio Club. They agreed and Gord became the President and Kieran became Treasurer.

Gord began working at Silcom Research, and Peter Williams VE3TFP joined as Secretary. Later, Brian Crook VE3CRG, also of Silcom, joined to help out. Other employees, John Heckman and Gavin Hurlbut (VE3GJH) wrote their exams and joined. Gavin sold Gord his copy of the Borland C compiler, so Gord started compiling and distributing versions of JNOS for folks to use. You can still see Gord's call in some of the binaries floating around!

Kieran, Peter and Gord, were experimenting with 9,600 bps modems in TAPR/MFJ TNCs, coupled with UHF TEK radios and rolling versions of JNOS so they could learn more about TCP/IP. Kieran set up VE3OSQ BBS and Peter started experimenting with satellites. This is when Gord took over IP administration of the 102 and 103 subnets, so that we could make a routeable RF subnet. With Barry VE3JF's help, Gord was able to NFS mount hydra.ampr.org's disk on his home SUN station, through the 9,600 bps radios. Kieran could get a path to Ottawa on 56 Kbps, so the idea was floated to make a link that extended from Ottawa to Belleville, Kingston, backhaul on 9,600, drop off at 1,200 bps. Kingston had a subnet, Belleville had a subnet, Renfrew had a subnet, Arnprior had a subnet, and of course Ottawa West had a subnet. Gord designed it so that it was all CIDR routeable.

Eventually, the UHF radios and cans from Gord's home system became part of the 9,600 bps link at Lavant. Peter supplied a PC and a version of JNOS. Phil VE3CIQ, supplied RF design, and George Sampson VE3GWS supplied access. The group met at Barrie VE3BSB's place to get support for an Ottawa West-Belleville link.

### The 90's

As Gord relates "By this time, WCARC had reached a membership of 35 strong as I recall, and was meeting in the Legion building in Stittsville, but the air was really smoky in there. Somewhere in here, Manfred VA3MWK, of IGS fame joined the club and we had a web page on his company's server. Anyway, my wife, Trudy VE3TRD and I had Julie in 1995, and I became too busy so Peter VE3TFP took over the reins of the club".

### 2005

In 2005, our executive included President Tom VA3NFA, Secretary Graham VE3BYT, Treasurer Ken VA3KA and VP/webmaster Rick VE3CVG. Highlights of the year included a family tour to the Diefenbunker in the spring, led by Tom, 903MHz transverter build program co-ordinated by Rick VE3CVG, our relocation to Sobeys in Kanata as a meeting centre, VE3WCC/R rover co-ordinated by VA3NFA in the September VHF contest. The club was well represented at several local ham flea markets. Our closing meeting for the year was our election, with Christmas snacks and lots of prizes.

### 2006

For 2006, the same executive was elected. Our meetings continued at Sobeys. The opening meeting included an excellent talk by VO1NO about war communications. Early in 2006 we successfully activated our 903 beacon on 903.37MHz (roughly). The RF parts came from Rick VE3CVG and the ID controller came from Gord VE3PPE. The beacon was located near NRC courtesy of Phil VE3CIQ.

Throughout the first quarter, the club continued to add members.

### 2007

In 2007, WCARC had a total of 26 members, with an average turnout of 10 members per meeting.

In January, Tom, VA3NFA hosted/tested the club 432 CW beacon, our 903 beacon was heard in Southwestern Ontario during a tropo opening, and VA3WK gave an overview of the latest digital proportional radio control equipment.

In February, VE3AAQ (Dave Goodwin), President of Radio Amateurs of Canada, gave a "RAC Update". We also had the first presentation to WCARC by the Ottawa Amateur Radio Digital Group (OARDG) (Rick VE3CVG and Ken VA3KA) on D-STAR.

In March, we initiated a group order of PCB antennas organised by Tom, VA3NFA, and Rick, VE3CVG and Doug, VE3XK gave a talk an demo on Tellurometers.

In April we had discussions on Hydro Smart Meters that are using 900 Mhz; Dale, VE3XZT talked on WinDRM digital voice using the PC sound card; Rick, VE3CVG showed a 10GHz feed suitable for a 2 foot dish; and several members attended the Iroquois Flea Market. Also, D-STAR Ottawa (VA3ODG) became operational from the Ottawa YMCA HQ building on Argyle Street, Ottawa.

In May, the Club had a Diefenbunker Tour attended by several members and some family members. Also WCARC had a presence at the Stittsville Flea Market, along with demos, and giveways by OARDG members who are also members of WCARC.

In June, VA3NFA and VA3CDD participated in VHF Contest as local rovers assisted by other club members.

In July, VA3SAX talked about Microwave Software-Defined Radio (uW SDR) project; we had a discussion on the June 6m opening to the West and Pacific.

In August, VE3NVK (Andy) showed his SoftRock-40 kit (40M SDR receiver); VO1NO showed his control and switching for his 160m beverage antenna farm.

In September, at the OARC Hamfest, WCARC had a club table, presentation by VA3NFA on Roving and VE3XK on D-STAR.

In October, we discussed a potential future project (DX-pedition and balloon launch) promoted by Graham VE3BYT and earlier by Barry VE3BSB; Rick showed the 10Ghz DEMI transverter kit; discussion, led by VE8CF (Karl) on "Free Energy".

In November, Tom, VA3NFA donated a box of VHF engineering stuff for beacon use; we discussed a June 2008 VHF/UHF QSO Party DX-pedition; VE3BYT outlined a proposal for a comprehensive club project (e.g. balloon launch); VE3XK showed crimping tools for N connectors.

### 2008

*President Al (VO1NO/VE3) wrote (this is an excerpt, because we just would not have space for everything Al said).*

2008 was a busy and exciting year for the West Carleton Amateur Radio Club.  Among other things, the club initiated a comprehensive beacon project, participated in a grid expedition, and got its constitutional affairs in order.

The Beacon Project was undoubtedly the club's most important undertaking this past year.  Under the leadership of Doug VE3XK, the club assembled a professional-quality set of VHF/UHF beacons and associated antennas.  The decision to use commercial-grade equipment in lieu of a more "home-brew" approach cost the club more money, but resulted in a thoroughly stable and reliable arrangement that should give years of trouble-free operation.  Given that Ottawa is fast becoming a focal point of weak-signal VHF/UHF activity, the beacons will permit local Amateurs to calibrate their equipment, and will alert others to propagation openings.

In June several members of the club travelled to FN04xa for the ARRL June VHF QSO Party.  Led by Al VO1NO, the team consisted of Doug VE3XK, Ken VA3KA, Barney VA3BGB, Andy VE3NVK, Dean VA3CDD, and Jeremy, N0CALL.  The team stumbled upon an excellent operating location overlooking Lake Ontario!  Previously a well-kept secret of Rovers, the site enabled the team to put outstanding signals into the northern USA.  A score of 80,620 points gave the team the top Canadian position, and #3 in its category in all of the ARRL Central Region.  Our efforts were very much appreciated - the club received a letter of thanks from Bill VE3CRU/Rover, who included several gifts and handouts to encourage the club to return to the site next year.  Al has agreed to head the Grid Expedition Committee for 2009.

The Constitution and Bylaws formed the third focus of the club in 2008.  The Constitutional Committee, made up of Doug VE3XK and Dean VA3CDD, continued work begun the previous year.  Draft documents were distributed early in the new-year, and feedback was incorporated in the succeeding versions.  Following a line-by-line review at the August meeting, the club's new Constitution and Bylaws were unanimously approved by the membership, and formally incorporated the following month.

Club members are also involved in several other projects.  Graham VE3BYT actively liaises with members of the Perth group to coordinate WCARC participation in their high altitude balloon launches (with Montessori School).  Rick VE3CVG and Ken VA3KA have taken leadership roles in the formation of the Ottawa Amateur Radio Digital Group, devoted to the establishment of a D-STAR network in the region.  Many other members are busy with their own projects of varying degrees of complexity.

The Repeater Committee under Dale VE3XZT has accomplished a great deal in the past 2 months.  The IRLP node is once again functioning after being shut down in the summer when John VE3IAO moved.  An ID EPROM has been received from Hamtronics, and all club repeaters will ID using the VE3WCC callsign.

The club had a variety of interesting guest speakers and entertainment.  January saw the kickoff of the Beacon Project with a briefing by Doug VE3XK. In February Dale VE3XZT and Ken VA3KA described Frequency Division Multiplex Digital Voice, and included an interesting practical demonstration.  March was Project Night!  Among the projects exhibited were the beacon cabinet by Doug VE3XK, a temperature sensor with associated microprocessor and mini-transmitter by Graham VE3BYT, and a CW station controller project by Dave VE3KL.

In April Ernie VA3OEB gave the first of 2 presentations dealing with his experiences as a radio operator during the Second World War.  The first covered the time he spent at sea in the Merchant Marine, which included having 2 ships sunk underneath him!  Ernie's second talk was given in July, and described how he and others intercepted enemy radio communications at the Ottawa Monitoring Station.

In May Barrie VE3BSB described the high-altitude balloon launch conducted by the Perth ARES group. The following month Al VO1NO briefed all present on the club's plans for the Grid Expedition to FN04xa for the ARRL June VHF QSO Party.  Also that evening, Doug VE3XK provided an update on the Beacon Project, including some interesting antenna radiation diagrams.

The Constitution and Bylaws were discussed and approved at the August meeting.  In September Al VO1NO delivered a detailed description of Low Band Receive Antennas.  The following month Bertrand VE2ZAZ gave a very interesting presentation on his experiences using EME - Earth Moon Earth, or Moonbounce.  Ken VE3SRS concluded the year's entertainment with a talk on his time operating as VE8RCS in Alert.

Membership peaked at 28 members.  Although a relatively small club, the West Carleton Amateur Radio Club has a well-deserved reputation for technical expertise and excellent operators.  This is no accident - it has taken a lot of hard work by a number of very dedicated individuals to put the West Carleton Club where it is.  I ask you to join me in a round of applause for those people, and for the success of the club in general.  I also remind everyone that each and every member of the club has something to offer - please remember this the next time the club needs a volunteer!

### 2009

*On December 1, 2009, President Al Penney, delivered the following Annual Report:*

Once again, the West Carleton Amateur Radio Club has had a busy and productive year.  Among other things, the club made significant progress on its comprehensive beacon project, finished first in a grid expedition during the ARRL June VHF QSO Party, and initiated a 5.8 GHz telephone project to assist the club's future contest ambitions.

Under the leadership of Doug VE3XK, the club assembled a professional-quality set of VHF/UHF beacons and associated antennas and power supply.  Following successful trials, the beacons were relocated from FN15wg to FN15vf in July 2009.  The stacked antennas, mounted on a single common mast, should launch most of the power at an elevation angle of 20-30 degrees above the horizon.  Due largely to the dedication of WCARC members, Ottawa is fast becoming a focal point of weak-signal VHF/UHF activity, as evidenced by a very complimentary mention in CQ Magazine.  The beacons will permit local Amateurs to calibrate their equipment, and will alert others to propagation openings.

In June, several members of the club returned to FN04xa for the ARRL June VHF QSO Party.  Led by Al VO1NO, the team consisted of Doug VE3XK, Ken VA3KA, Barney VA3BGB, Andy VE3NVK, Stephen VE3LWX, Glenn VE3XRA, Bill VE3NNQ, and Air Cadets Erin, Abigail, Michael and Dalton, all of whom are studying to earn their Basic licenseAmateur Radio in a course taught by Al VO1NO.  In a very busy weekend, they made 496 QSOs and 176 multipliers for a score of 134,816, a significant improvement over the previous year.  This was enough to finish first in any category in Canada, and first in the ARRL Central Region in the Multi-Op category.  The club is looking forward to defending their excellent results in next year's competition, by which time the Air Cadets should be licensed!

Later in the year, Doug VE3XK reported to the club that certain 5.8 GHz cordless telephones could be used as Amateur transceivers.  Given enough telephones, the club could greatly increase its Grid Expedition score by lending them to rovers passing through the area, and because of rules that permit multi-op stations to work their own operators on microwave frequencies.  In a trial, Doug and Barney VA3BGB determined that far from being limited to a few hundred feet as advertised, the telephones actually had ranges measured in kilometres.  Based on this, the club approved the acquisition of a number of  these phones, and several members are actively investigating how to connect high gain antennas to the devices.

In January the club presented a plaque to Manfred VE3WK in appreciation for his donation of two complete repeaters.  A similar presentation was made to Kieran VA3KS in September for his donation of antennas and other equipment, the sale of which greatly bolstered the club's bank account.  In November, both ManfredManfred and Kieran, as well as Phil VE3CIQ, were inducted as the club's first lifetime members.  Phil's place of honour is due to his invaluable assistance in obtaining and maintaining access to commercial towers for the club's repeaters and beacons system.

The club had a variety of interesting guest speakers and entertainment.  January saw Al VO1NO deliver a presentation titled "Chase Me Charlies", an account of how the Allies developed electronic countermeasures to Nazi radio-controlled bombs in World War II. In February club members watched a video presentation on the 3Y0X DX-pedition to Peter 1 Island in 2006.  In March, club members received 3 presentations.  Doug VE3XK gave a detailed briefing on the club's repeaters, and Rick VE3CVG demonstrated a portable Web server.  Rick also unveiled the WCARC Minutes Generator software that he developed with his friend Bob Chambers.  This excellent program permits the club secretary to generate meeting minutes much more swiftly and accurately than previously possible, and is now in use by the club.

In April Dave VE3KL described the excellent attributes of the NEC2 antenna software developed by Dutch Ham Arie Voors.  In May, Al VO1NO briefed the membership on the club's Grid Expedition in June.  Due to scheduling difficulties with Sobey's, the June and July meetings were held in the Diefenbunker, thanks to Brian Jeffrey VE3UU and the Directors of the Diefenbunker Museum.  The June meeting featured a roundtable discussion on all aspects of the Expedition, from antennas to food, and photos of the event were displayed at the July meeting.

August was the Club's Show and Tell evening.  Of note, Peter VA3PJ displayed several pieces of radar equipment in which he had played a part in developing.  Doug VE3XK also gave an update on the status of the club's beacons.  In September Air Cadet Erin Burrell, a member of the Grid Expedition, demonstrated the CO2 powered car that she had built for her technology class.  Inspired by the expedition, she painted "VE3WCC" on either side!  The members also watched an interesting presentation called "Zoom" on the powers of 10.  To cap off the evening, Al VO1NO described Operation Crossroads, the American atomic bomb tests in the Bikini Atoll in 1946.

In October Michael VE3WMB described HF Portable Operations, and demonstrated several innovative techniques and pieces of equipment.  The following month Norm VE3LC spoke about Amateur applications for Bluetooth technology, especially appropriate given the new law that bans the use of handheld communications devices while driving.

Membership peaked at 32 members.  Attendance at the meetings also increased significantly over 2008.

Some "off-site" activities by club members should also be recognized.  Ken Asmus VA3KA gave a presentation on our grid expedition to FN04xa, to the Ontario VHF Association October meeting in Toronto.  Doug Leach VE3XK also gave a presentation on our VHF/UHF beacon project.  Several towers were disassembled in the field and the tower sections and antennas placed in storage for sale by WCARC, for fund-raising.  WCARC exhibit tables at Iroquois (April), Smith Falls (May) and Carp (September) raised substantial revenue for club activities.  Doug VE3XK also gave a presentation on the VHF/UHF beacon project to the Ottawa Amateur Radio Club.  Our WCARC web site, under web master Rick Bandla VE3CVG continues to provide a comprehensive display of club activities for members and others interested in our many past projects.  Finally, Al VO1NO is engaged in teaching a Basic Course to a group of 10 Air Cadets and parents.

Although a relatively small club, the West Carleton Amateur Radio Club has maintained a well-deserved reputation for technical expertise and excellent operators.  This is no accident - it has taken a lot of hard work by a number of very dedicated individuals to put the West Carleton Club where it is.  I ask you to join me in a round of applause for those people, and for the success of the club in general.  I also remind everyone that each and every member of the club has something to offer - please remember this the next time the club needs a volunteer!

### 2010

*On December 7, 2010, President Al Penney, delivered this Annual Report:*

Once again, the West Carleton Amateur Radio Club has had a busy and productive year.  Among other things, the club completed its comprehensive beacon project, finished second in a grid expedition during the ARRL June VHF QSO Party, supported the development of D-Star Radio, sold its repeater system, and completed a 5.8 GHz telephone project that was used in the contest.  Additionally, many club members built Bluetooth-radio interfaces to comply with upcoming changes in Ontario's driving regulations.

Under the solid leadership of Doug VE3XK, the club's professional-quality set of VHF/UHF beacons have continued to put Ottawa on the VHF/UHF map.  Other than an occasional truncation in the last character of the grid identifier, the system has performed flawlessly.  Reception reports have been received from as far away as Florida and British Columbia.  The beacons also permit local Amateurs to calibrate their equipment, and will alert others to propagation openings.  Extra bands are being considered for next year, including a 1296 MHz beacon, and possibly even a 10 GHz beacon.

In June several members of the club returned to FN04xa for the third year in a row to take part in the ARRL June VHF QSO Party.  Led by Al VO1NO, the team consisted of Doug VE3XK, Barney VA3BGB, Glenn VE3XRA, Greg VA3OMP, Sam VE3CMS, Drew VE3UIN and Air Cadets Erin and Laura.  In a very busy weekend, they were credited with 330 QSOs and 130 multipliers for a score of 65,520 points.  This was down from the previous year, but was enough to finish second in our category in Canada.  Our decline in the standings this year can be attributed to propagation conditions and to having fewer operators this time.  The pitiful excuses ranged from "I'm getting married that weekend" to "I have a sucking chest wound"!  Nevertheless, the club is looking forward to regaining top position next year!

One success story out of the contest was the 5.8 GHz telephone system project.  Glenn VE3XRA took on the task of transforming a normally short-ranged home telephone system into something that would support communications over a range of several kilometres.  By mounting the main unit at the focal point of a satellite TV antenna, Glenn was able to obtain the desired increase in performance.  It was used to good effect during the contest, obtaining several extra grids and many points for the team.

In May the owners of the tower that housed the club's VHF and UHF repeater systems requested that the club remove them.  When the club began investigating possible sites to relocate the repeaters, it became apparent that most would require sizeable annual payments.  In July however the Almonte Amateur Radio Club approached the Executive with an offer to purchase both systems.  Following a vote, the membership approved the sale.  This is a win-win situation for both clubs.  The Almonte club has two repeaters located at publicly-funded locations available for their emergency communications obligations.  On the other hand, the footprint of these repeaters is generally similar to the West Carleton's previous setup, and being open repeaters they are still available to West Carleton members.

The club had a variety of interesting guest speakers and entertainment.  January saw two presentations.  Bert VE2ZAZ briefed everyone on his Bluetooth-radio interface kit.  Interest was so great that more than 30 were eventually sold to club members.  Barrie VE3BSB described the high-altitude balloon activities of the Lanark Space Agency in a presentation titled "Amateur Radio Journeys to the Edge of Space".  The agency must be doing something right, as they recently set a new world altitude record for amateur balloons.

There were also two presentations at the February meeting.  Glenn VE3XRA gave an update on the 5.8 GHz phone system, while Michael VE3WMB spoke about "New Digital Modes and Old Hellschriber".  In March Rick VE3CVG described the past, present and future of D-Star radio, and in April Ray VE3FN spoke about Amateur Radio Microwave Communications.  It should be noted that at the April meeting the membership voted to support the Ottawa Amateur Radio Digital Group's efforts to develop D-Star Radio in the area with a $300 donation.

Dave VE3KL gave a technical description of the many uses of ferrites in Amateur Radio at the May meeting.  June saw another technical presentation as Bert VE2ZAZ spoke about Spectrum Analyzers and Network Analyzers.  It included a demonstration of an analyzer so big that required 3 men and 2 horses to get it up the steps!

In July Al VO1NO described the club's Grid Expedition for the June VHF Contest, while in August fellow-grid expedition member Glenn VE3XRA spoke about radio astronomy and his interesting career experiences as a radio astronomer.  Al VO1NO was the guest speaker again in September.  In a presentation titled "A Race on the Edge of Time" he described how the British developed not just radar, but an entire air defence system as well, and how it defeated the Luftwaffe in the Battle of Britain.

October and November marked a return to purely Amateur Radio topics.  In October Andy VE3NVK described the wide range of digital modes available using the fldigi software.  The following month Greg VE3YTZ delivered an informative talk on TAPR's Software Defined Radio project.

Membership peaked at 32 regular members and 3 life members.  Attendance at the meetings remained very high, with 26 at the February meeting - possibly a club record:

* January	  15
* February  26
* March	  18
* April	  19

### 2011

There was an excellent article on WCARC and our DXpeditions in the [West Carleton Review - July 21, 2011](news/press1.html).

*On December 6, 2011, President Al Penney (VO1NO), delivered the following Annual Report:*

The West Carleton Amateur Radio Club has had yet another busy and productive year!  The club regained first place in Canada in its annual grid expedition for the
ARRL June VHF QSO Party, played a key part in the ongoing development of the City of Ottawa's antenna policy, initiated a 24 GHz project using police radars, and scored a
major publicity success.

The club's professional-quality set of VHF/UHF beacons have continued to put Ottawa on the VHF/UHF map.  Reception reports have been received from all over North
America and as far away as the Azores.  The beacons were down several times early in the new year due to a defective ground fault circuit breaker, but thanks to Dale (VE3XZT),
that has been fixed and the beacons have functioned well since then.

In June several members of the club returned to FN04xa for the fourth year in a row to take part in the ARRL June VHF QSO Party.  Having finished second in Canada
in last year's contest, the group was determined to regain their rightful position at the very top!  Led by Al VO1NO, the team consisted of Barney (VA3BGB), Glenn (VE3XRA), Greg
(VA3OMP), Sam (VE3CMS), Andy (VE3NVK), Ray (VE3BBV), Allan (VA3FMN), Michael (VE3ARL), Bert (VE2ZAZ), several hams from Hamilton, and Air Cadets Erin, Kristin and Kristian.  In a very busy
weekend, they were credited with XXX QSOs and XXX multipliers for a score of 86,335 points.  This was an improvement from the previous year, and made us top multiop station
not just in our category in Canada, but also in all of the ARRL Central region!  Part of our resurgence can be attributed to increasing our multiplier totals by expanding into
the 2.4 GHz band.  This was thanks in large part to Glenn (VE3XRA), who used WiFi equipment and helical antennas built by Claire (VE3NPC).  The sight of the antennas on tripods
alongside country roads made many a driver slow down, fearing a police radar trap!

The move into 2.4 GHz was sparked by the decision of many of the club's members to participate in a bulk purchase of 1-watt WiFi USB adaptors.  In addition to operating
in part of the Amateur allocation in that range, they permit solid WiFi access from greater distances than would normally be the case.

The club also initiated a move into even higher frequencies.  After a presentation on police radars and breathalysers by Greg (VA3OMP) at the March meeting, Greg's
boss granted the club permission to use several defective radars, and several members are attempting to convert the units into transceivers that can be used in the June
contest.  Greg's presentation also sparked a great deal of discussion in how to jam police radars!

The club had a variety of interesting guest speakers and entertainment.  January saw two presentations.  Bert (VE2ZAZ) briefed everyone on his Bluetooth-radio
interface kit.  Interest was so great that more than 30 were eventually sold to club members.  Barrie (VE3BSB) described the high-altitude balloon activities of the Lanark
Space Agency in a presentation titled "Amateur Radio Journeys to the Edge of Space".  The agency must be doing something right, as they recently set a new world altitude
record for amateur balloons.

There were also two presentations at the February meeting.  Glenn (VE3XRA) gave an update on the 5.8 GHz phone system, while Michael (VE3WMB) spoke about
"New Digital Modes and Old Hellschriber".  In March Rick (VE3CVG) described the past, present and future of D-STAR radio, and in April Ray (VE3FN) spoke about Amateur
Radio Microwave Communications.  It should be noted that at the April meeting the membership voted to support the Ottawa Amateur Radio Digital Group's efforts to develop
D-STAR Radio in the area with a $300 donation.

Dave (VE3KL) gave a technical description of the many uses of ferrites in Amateur Radio at the May meeting.  June saw another technical presentation as Bert (VE2ZAZ)
spoke about Spectrum Analyzers and Network Analyzers.  It included a demonstration of an analyzer so big that required 3 men and 2 horses to get it up the steps!

In July, Al (VO1NO) described the club's Grid Expedition for the June VHF Contest, while in August fellow-grid expedition member Glenn (VE3XRA) spoke about
radio astronomy and his interesting career experiences as a radio astronomer.  Al VO1NO was the guest speaker again in September.  In a presentation titled "A Race on the
Edge of Time" he described how the British developed not just radar, but an entire air defence system as well, and how it defeated the Luftwaffe in the Battle of Britain.

October and November marked a return to purely Amateur Radio topics.  In October, Andy (VE3NVK) described the wide range of digital modes available using the FLDigi
software.  The following month Greg (VE3YTZ) delivered an informative talk on TAPR's Software Defined Radio project.

Membership peaked at 32 regular members and 3 life members.  Attendance at the meetings remained very high, with 26 at the February meeting - possibly a club record:

* January	15

Although a relatively small club, the West Carleton Amateur Radio Club has maintained a well-deserved reputation for technical expertise and excellent operators.  This is no accident - it has taken a lot of hard work by a number of very dedicated individuals to put the West Carleton Club where it is.  I ask you to join me in a round of applause for those people, and for the success of the club in general.  I also remind everyone that each and every member of the club has something to offer - please remember this the next time the club needs a volunteer!

### 2012

*On December 4, 2012, President Al Penney (VO1NO), provided the following Annual Report:*

The West Carleton Amateur Radio Club has had yet another busy and productive year.  The club maintained first place in Canada in its annual grid expedition for the ARRL June
VHF QSO Party, played a key part in the development of the City of Ottawa's antenna policy, successfully completed a 24 GHz project using police radars, and received
noteworthy mention in TCA, Canada's national Amateur Radio magazine.

In June several members of the club returned to FN04xa for the fifth year in a row to take part in the ARRL June VHF QSO Party.  Led by Al (VO1NO), the team
consisted of Ken (VA3KA), Bill (VE3MMQ), Glenn (VE3XRA), Ray (VE3BBV), Allan (VA3FMN), Michael (VE3ARL), Bert (VE2ZAZ), Alex, and Air Cadets Kristin and Darla.  In a very busy weekend,
they were credited with a score of 278,496 points.  This was a huge improvement from the previous top score of 134,816 in 2009, and made us top station in Canada, and number
20 of all stations anywhere in the world!  This can be attributed to several factors, including an excellent opening on 6 meters, but also our continuing expansion into new
bands in search of QSOs and multipliers.  This year we operated on 24 GHz thanks to the engineering expertise of Bert (VE2ZAZ) and surplus defective police radars courtesy of
Greg (VA3OMP).  If last year's WiFi antennas caused many a driver to slow down upon sighting them, then this year's modified police radars must have caused consternation to
owners of (illegal) radar detectors!  Dana (VE3KU), Six Metres and Down columnist in TCA magazine, asked for a description of the expedition.  After a few iterations to ensure
that no "classified" information would be released to our competition, Al VO1NO submitted an article that was published later that year.

The club had a variety of interesting guest speakers and entertainment.  January saw Al (VO1NO) describe the installation of a ScanEagle UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle)
system in the Navy frigate HMCS Charlottetown in time for its deployment to the Mediterranean for NATO duties.  It included technical duties of its control system, and a
video of launches and recoveries.  In February, Bert (VE2ZAZ) described the process he uses for the design and manufacture of printed circuit boards for his projects.

Due to renovations at the Sobeys, the March meeting was held at Mobile Knowledge thanks to Jeff (VE3EFF).  Instead of a guest speaker, members engaged in a
'show and tell" of their latest projects.  The guest speaker for April was Al (VO1NO), who described his expedition to Bon Portage Island for the 2011 IOTA Contest.

In May, the club decided to cancel the http://www.wc-arc.org domain name to save the club webhosting fees and save the webmaster, Rick (VE3CVG), considerable work.
Up til then he had maintained identical information on 2 different websites - http://www.wc-arc.org, the site which had been set up while trying to recover the original
club URL; and the long standing url, http://wcarc.on.ca/.  The original url was recovered thanks to the efforts of Jeff (VA3ISP).

Also in May it was announced that WCARC secretary Glenn (VE3XRA) had been named Deputy Director for the RAC Ontario North East section.  As well, Bert (VE2ZAZ)
delivered an excellent description of how he modified defective police 24 GHz radars to operate as full duplex transceivers.

In June, Bert (VE2ZAZ) demonstrated a USB dongle Software Defined Receiver that operated between 64 MHz and 1.7 GHz.  Al (VO1NO) spoke about the plan for the
upcoming Grid Expedition in July.

The possibility of vehicle warning radars was discussed in July when Glenn (VE3XRA) reported on a meeting he had attended with representatives of Bosch from
Germany concerning their desire to use spectrum around 77 GHz for short range automotive radar.  Later that meeting, Al (VO1NO) gave an account of the club's Grid
Expedition to FN04xa.

In August, Andy (VE3NVK) demonstrated his most recent acquisition - a Raspberry Pi computer.  Al (VO1NO) also spoke about Near Vertical Incidence Skywave (NVIS)
propagation.  For the September meeting members had a spirited discussion as part of a roundtable discussion on all aspects of Amateur Radio.

Bert (VE2ZAZ) spoke again in October, this time about automating instrument measurements.  Rounding out the year in November, Doug (VE3XK) delivered an interesting
presentation on RF propagation.

The club's professional-quality set of VHF/UHF beacons have continued to put Ottawa on the VHF/UHF map.  Reception reports have been received from all over North
America.  There have been several discussions about implementing a beacon for 1296 MHz.  The current setup has physical room for an additional module, but unfortunately the
club does not have the financial resources to undertake such a project at present.  As well, the head of the Beacon project, Doug (VE3XK), is investigating moving the beacons
in order to improve their coverage.

In April, Glenn (VE3XRA) reported that the Ottawa City Council had approved its new Municipal Concurrence and Public Consultation Process at their March 18 meeting.
Representatives of the ad-hoc group of Radio Amateurs from across the Ottawa area, formed to respond to the City proposal, met with City staff in March and reached an
agreement that met the City's concerns for encouraging antennas to be located in less visually intrusive locations, while also recognizing the requirements for adequate
antennas to serve Radio Amateur needs.   Several members of the West Carleton Amateur Radio Club played important parts in this consultation process.

Membership peaked at 23 regular members and 3 life members.  Attendance at the meetings was down considerable from the previous year:

* January	14
* February 10
* March 10
* April 8
* May 15
* June 8
* July 10
* August 9
* September 11
* October	18
* November 13

The Executive recognized the decreased attendance, and made efforts to improve it, with some success late in the year.  This is a continuing issue however, and
will be monitored.

Although a relatively small club, the West Carleton Amateur Radio Club has maintained a well-deserved reputation for technical expertise and excellent operators.
This is no accident - it has taken a lot of hard work by a number of very dedicated individuals to put the West Carleton Club where it is.  Once again, I ask you to join me
in a round of applause for those people, and for the success of the club in general.  I also remind everyone that each and every member of the club has something to offer -
please remember this the next time the club needs a volunteer!

### 2013

*On December 3, 2013, A/President Clayton Smith (VE3IRR), delivered this Annual Report:*

The West Carleton Amateur Radio Club has had another busy and productive year.  The Club had its best ever result in the ARRL June VHF Contest, began a 2304 MHz
transverter project, replaced one beacon and added one new beacon, for a total complement of six.

In June the club returned to grid square FN04xa for the sixth consecutive year to compete in the ARRL June VHF Contest.  The club had its best ever result,
finishing in 14th place overall.  The team consisted of Al (VO1NO), Glenn (VE3XRA), Bill (VE3MMQ), Allan (VA3FMN), Michael (VE3ARL), Dave (VE3AAQ), Richard (VE3KI), Steven (VA3EXS),
Bert (VE2ZAZ), Ray (VE3BVV), Sam (VE3CMS), Greg (VA3OMP) and Clayton (VE3IRR), as well as Air Cadets Kristin, Darla and Steph.  The team's final score of 194,575 points also
gave them the highest score in Canada, highest in the Central Region, and 6th among unlimited multi-op stations.  Plans are already under way to participate in the 2014 June
VHF Contest, perhaps from a new location.

Bert (VE2ZAZ) built a 2304 MHz transverter from surplus Harris equipment, based on a prototype made by Jimmy Howard (VE2JWH).  Bert used his transverter to make
a number of 2304 MHz contacts in the June VHF Contest.  He has organized a club project to build more transverters, with another 13 members participating.  Construction
will get under way following the December meeting.

Early in the year, Rick (VE3CVG) built and installed two beacons for the club, operating at 903.360 MHz and 1296.060 MHz from a downtown Ottawa location.
These complement the club's existing 6m, 2m, 1.25m and 70cm beacons, which are located in Almonte and maintained by Doug (VE3XK).  In the fall, repairs to the
antenna support for the 6m beacon were performed by Phil (VE3CIQ) assisted by Dale Hennigar (VE3XZT) and Doug (VE3XK).

The club had a full schedule of interesting presentations. [Materials](presentations.html) from many of them are available on the club's web site.

* Bert (VE2ZAZ) - Fibre optic communication
* Dave (VE3AAQ) - Ham Radio Culture Shock
* Martin (VA3SIE) - Summits on the Air
* Wayne (VE3CZO) - 1296 MHz amplifier design
* Andy (VE3NVK) - Raspberry Pi
* Marcus (VE3MDL) - Amateur radio astronomy and software-defined radio
* Al (VO1NO) - Grid expedition stories & photos
* Bert (VE2ZAZ) - Primer on digital modulation schemes
* Clayton (VE3IRR) - Building software-defined radio with GNU Radio
* Rick (VE3CVG) - WCARC 33cm and 23cm beacons, Apache Labs ANAN-10
* Doug (VE3XK) - Adding a panoramic display to my TS2000

Attendance [numbers] at this year's meetings were up slightly compared to the previous year, but still lower than earlier years:

* January	8
* February	10
* March	13
* April	13
* May		11
* June	16
* July	14
* August	15
* September	16
* October	14
* November	12
* December	15

Membership was down slightly compared to the previous year, with 22 regular members (vs. 23) and three life members.

The Ottawa Valley Upper Frequencies SSB Net continued to operate throughout the year, with participation typically around five to ten stations.  Glenn (VE3XRA), Rick (VE3CVG),
Bert (VE2ZAZ) and Clayton (VE3IRR) acted as Net Control [rephrased].

The Club's website, maintained by Rick (VE3CVG), [and hosted on web servers of Jeff Dale (VA3ISP)], continue to be well-used. Access should improve since a couple of technical issues were
resolved [with the assistance of Clayton (VE3IRR)]. It is now indexed by Google, which should make the information much easier to find.

After serving as President since 2008, Al (VO1NO) resigned in August due to his relocation to Nova Scotia.  Clayton (VE3IRR) took over his duties for the remainder of the
year as acting president.  The club would like to thank Al for his many contributions to the club, especially his tireless organization of the club's annual grid expeditions.
He will be greatly missed.

Please join me in thanking all the people who made 2013 a successful year for the club: the Executive, Presenters, Webmaster, Net Controllers, contest operators, members
and visitors.

### 2014

*On December 2, 2014, President Clayton Smith (VE3IRR), delivered this Annual Report:*

The West Carleton Amateur Radio Club had another busy and productive year in 2014.  The Club participated in the ARRL June VHF Contest from a new grid square, launched a Broadband-Hamnet mesh network, and rebuilt some of its propagation beacons.

In June, the Club once again competed in the ARRL June VHF Contest, but this time from a new location: the Corkery Community Centre located in grid square FN15xg.  The closer location was chosen to allow more members the opportunity to participate.  In previous years, Al (VO1NO) had supplied much of the equipment.  After his relocation to Nova Scotia, it seemed likely that the Club station would have to be scaled back, but thanks to generous donations from George VE3BNO, Ray VE3FN and an anonymous donor, the VE3WCC contest station was very well equipped.

The contest operators were Bert (VE2ZAZ), Ray (VE3FN), Clayton (VE3IRR), Rich (VE3KI), David (VE3KL), Andy (VE3NVK), Doug (VE3XK), Glenn (VE3XRA) and Ken (VA3KA).  Many others visited the station and helped with planning and logistics.  Despite challenging band conditions, the station made a respectable 192 contacts for a total of 27,636 points, scoring 5th place in Canada and 19th place among unlimited multi-op stations.  Contacts were made on all amateur bands from 50 MHz to 24 GHz, with 3.4 GHz being a new addition in 2014.  The Club thanks Doug (VE3XK) for his tireless efforts as the event's primary organizer.

The Club's 6m, 2m, 1.25m and 70cm beacons, located in Almonte, had to be taken off the air early in the year due to a malfunction.  Thanks to the efforts of Doug (VE3XK), Wayne (VE3CZO) and Phil (VE3CIQ), the source of the problem was located, and several parts were replaced. The beacons went back on the air in December.  The Club's 33cm and 23cm beacons, located in downtown Ottawa, continue to function well.

Club members Bert (VE2ZAZ), Rick (VE3CVG), Ying (VA3YH) and Clayton (VE3IRR) set up 2.4 GHz Broadband-Hamnet mesh nodes at three sites: Aylmer, downtown Ottawa and Kanata.  An 11-km Aylmer-Kanata link and a 21-km Kanata-Ottawa link now operate permanently.  Several other members are experimenting with Broadband-Hamnet equipment and hope to join the mesh network in the coming year.  Further information about the Club's efforts can be found at [http://ve2zaz.net/BBHN-Ottawa_www/](http://ve2zaz.net/BBHN-Ottawa_www/).

The club had a full schedule of interesting presentations. [Materials](presentations.html) from many of them are available on the club's web site.

* Bert Zauhar (VE2ZAZ) - Voice over IP Telephony on the Raspberry Pi
* Bob MacKenzie (VA3RKM) - Building Antennas
* David Frank (VE3DMU)   - Tracking, Decoding & Understanding 403 MHz Radiosonde Signals
* Dave Goodwin (VE3AAQ)  - Contest Operating
* Doug Leach (VE3XK)     - Nowcasting with DX Toolbox
* Bert Zauhar (VE2ZAZ)   - Broadband-Hamnet
* Wayne Getchell (VE3CZO) - A Panadapter for 70 MHz IF Transceivers
* David Conn (VE3KL) - Antenna Tuners Exposed

Attendance at this year's meetings was up slightly, compared to 2012 and 2013, averaging around 14:

* January	15
* February	10
* March	12
* April	12
* May		14
* June	20
* July	14
* August	 9
* September	14
* October	18
* November	16
* December	12

Membership was identical to the previous year, with 22 regular members and three life members.

The Ottawa Valley Upper Frequencies SSB Net continued to operate weekly throughout the year, with participation typically between five and ten stations.  Stations from the Montreal area often participated when conditions permitted, and on one occasion a distant U.S. station joined the net during the 6m roll call.  Glenn (VE3XRA) hosted the net most weeks, with Clayton (VE3IRR) filling in when Glenn was not available.

The club's website, maintained by Rick Bandla (VE3CVG) continues to operate well.

Please join me in thanking all the people who made 2014 a successful year for the club: the executive, presenters, webmaster, net controllers, contest operators, members and visitors.

### 2015

*On December 1, 2015, President Clayton Smith (VE3IRR), delivered this Annual Report:*

The West Carleton Amateur Radio Club had another productive year in 2015.  Among other activities, the Club participated in the ARRL June VHF Contest from grid square FN15 for the second year, expanded its Broadband-Hamnet mesh network, and rebuilt some of its propagation beacons.

In June, the Club once again competed in the ARRL June VHF Contest.  Like last year, the Corkery Community Centre was the base of operations, located in grid square FN15xg.  Donations and loans of station equipment played a big part in the success of the event.  Special thanks go to Greg VA3ITB for the donation of rotators and a tower, to Paul VE3PLE for the donation of a tower, to Ray VE3BVV for help with transportation, setup and tear-down, and to Margaret VA3VXN and Tyler VA3DGN for supplying meals.

The contest operators were Bert VE2ZAZ, Ray VE3FN, Clayton VE3IRR, Rich VE3KI, Doug VE3XK, Glenn VE3XRA, and Mike VE3FFK.  Many others visited the station and helped with planning and logistics.  Despite challenging band conditions during much of the contest, a six meter opening near the end of the contest period provided a large number of additional QSOs and multipliers.  The station made 280 contacts (up from 192 last year) for a total of 56,610 points, nearly double last year's score of 27,636.  That moved the Club up to 2nd place in Canada and 10th place among unlimited multi-op stations.  Contacts were made on all amateur bands from 50 MHz to 24 GHz.  Many more microwave contacts were made than the previous year thanks to the addition of several SDRs, and a successful microwave contact into grid square FN25 should pave the way for more microwave points next year.  The Club thanks Doug VE3XK for his tireless efforts as the event's primary organizer.

For the first half of the year, the Club's 2m, 1.25m and 70cm beacons operated from Almonte.  The 6m beacon was off the air due to a malfunction.  Doug VE3XK repaired the 6m beacon and made various improvements to the beacons, which were relocated in July to the home of Paul VE3PLE in Stittsville.  They have been operating well since then, and can be heard easily throughout most of the Ottawa area.  The Club receives occasional reports of distant reception.  The Club's 33cm and 23cm beacons, located in downtown Ottawa, continue to function well.

Club members Bert VE2ZAZ, Rick VE3CVG, Ying VA3YH and Clayton VE3IRR expanded the Broadband-Hamnet network, adding a 5.8 GHz link between Kanata and downtown Ottawa, and connecting Dave VE3KMV and Colin VE3CWQ to the mesh.  Tyler VA3DGN and Duane VA3ODD were also able to connect to the network, and may join as permanent nodes in the coming year.  Further information about the Club's efforts can be found at [http://ve2zaz.net/BBHN-Ottawa_www/](http://ve2zaz.net/BBHN-Ottawa_www/).

The club had a full schedule of interesting presentations.  [Materials](presentations.html) from many of them are available on the club's web site.

### 2016

*On December 19, 2016, President Clayton Smith (VE3IRR), delivered this Annual Report:*

The West Carleton Amateur Radio Club had another productive year in 2016.  Among other activities, the Club participated in the ARRL June VHF Contest from grid square FN15 for the third year, expanded its Broadband-Hamnet mesh network, and made improvements to its propagation beacons.

In June, the Club once again competed in the ARRL June VHF Contest.  Like the past two years, the Corkery Community Centre was the base of operations, located in grid square FN15xg.  Donations and loans of station equipment played a big part in the success of the event.  Special thanks go to Ray VE3BVV for help with transportation, setup and tear-down, Greg VA3ITB for help with setup and tear-down, and Doug VE3XK for repairing a large number of tellurometers.

The contest operators were Rich VE3KI, Ray VE3FN, Bert VE2ZAZ, Glenn VE3XRA, Doug VE3XK, Clayton VE3IRR, Ray VE3BVV, Malcolm VE2DDZ and Andy VE3NVK.  Many others visited the station and helped with planning and logistics. Conditions on the six metre band were very good for much of the contest, allowing for many more contacts than in previous years.  We contacted stations in 145 grid squares on that band alone, including several outside North America.  In total, we made 506 contacts (up from 280 last year) for a total of 141,372 points, more than double last year's score of 56,610.  That moved the Club up to 1st place in Canada.  We placed 10th among unlimited multi-op stations and 36th overall.  Contacts were made on all amateur bands from 50 MHz to 24 GHz.  Microwave contacts made using SDRs, WiFi equipment, cordless phones and tellurometers continued to provide a big boost to our score.  The Club thanks Doug VE3XK for his tireless efforts as the event's primary organizer, and Jim VE3ERA for the donation of two towers for use in future contests.

The Club's 6m, 2m, 1.25m and 70cm beacons continue to operate from the home of Paul VE3PLE in Stittsville.  Throughout the year, Doug VE3XK made a number of modifications and improvements.  The beacons continue to operate well, and can be heard easily throughout most of the Ottawa area.  The Club receives occasional reports of distant reception.  The Club's 33cm and 23cm beacons, located on the roof of the YMCA in downtown Ottawa, continue to function well.

The Ottawa-Gatineau Broadband-Hamnet, one of the Club’s projects, continues to expand with over 40 nodes now on the mesh network.  Since last year, many more Gatineau stations have joined the network.  Several Stittsville-area stations have succeeded in forming a small mesh, but have not yet been able to connect with the Ottawa-Gatineau mesh.  Further information about the Club's efforts can be found at [http://ve2zaz.net/BBHN-Ottawa_www/](http://ve2zaz.net/BBHN-Ottawa_www/).

The club had a full schedule of interesting presentations.  [Materials](presentations.html) from many of them are available on the club's web site.

* Bert Zauhar (VE2ZAZ) – An Electronically Disciplined Mechanical Pendulum
* Glenn MacDonell (VE3XRA) – Amateur Radio in Canada & RAC
* Bert Zauhar (VE2ZAZ) – Myths about ESD
* Clayton Smith (VE3IRR) – 2016 June VHF contest review
* Paul Boltwood (VE3PLE) – Accomplishments in Amateur Astronomy & Electronics
* Greg Danylchenko (VE3YTZ) – Extension Cords
* Bryan Rawlings (VE3QN) – Amateur Radio Regulation
* Dave Conn (VE3KL) – HF Wire Antennas, EMI and Contest Stations

Attendance at this year's meetings was up slightly compared to last year, averaging around 13:

* January	16
* February	14
* March		14
* April		10
* May		15
* June		10
* July		12
* August		17
* September	13
* October	13
* November	16
* December	17

Membership was somewhat lower than last year, with 19 regular members and three life members.  The Club’s regular meeting date was changed from the first Tuesday of the month to the third Monday to avoid a conflict with the Diefenbunker radio group’s meetings, and this is likely to result in increased attendance and membership in 2017.

The Ottawa Valley Upper Frequencies SSB Net continued to operate weekly throughout the year, with participation typically between five and ten stations.  Stations from the Montreal area participated when conditions permitted.  Glenn VE3XRA hosted the net most weeks.

After maintaining the Club’s website for more than a decade, Rick VE3CVG handed webmaster duties over to Clayton VE3IRR in September. The site continues to operate well.

Please join me in thanking all the people who made 2016 a successful year for the club: the executive, presenters, webmasters, net controllers, contest operators, members and visitors.
