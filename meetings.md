title: Club Meetings
---

The club meets on the third Monday of every month unless a change is
announced by email. Meetings begin at 19:00 local time.

Please note that WCARC meetings are informal: we usually have a
Treasurer's report and a very brief report on various projects that are
underway. We have a show-and-tell session at every meeting, so if you have
something that the rest of us might be interested in, bring it along. We also
talk quite a bit, as we have to get a whole month's worth of excitement packed
into a couple of hours.
