title: AAI-N2061SA Handheld Vector Network Analyzer
---

The N2061A Vector Impedance Analyzer is mainly used for testing antenna, RF component and circuit board impedance.  With built-in lithium ion battery, the unit is small enough to fit in a pocket and convenient for outdoor applications. A clear colour screen with simple pushbuttons makes it easy to use. (A simplified operating procedure is mounted on the rear side). It includes coverage of the HF, VHF and UHF amateur radio bands up to 1300 Mhz.
