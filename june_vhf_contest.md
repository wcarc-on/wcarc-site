title: 2023 ARRL June VHF Contest
---

From June 9<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup>, the West Carleton Amateur Radio Club will once again participate in the ARRL June VHF contest. This will be our 14<sup>th</sup> year competing as a multi-operator station (VE3WCC). We'll be operating from the [Kinburn Community Centre](https://www.kinburn.ca/), which is located West of Ottawa, between Carp and Arnprior.

Helping with setup of the station is a great opportunity for beginners to get experience setting up a station. You'll learn how to assemble antennas, towers, rotors, coax, radios, and logging software.

Although we have scored very well in past years, this isn't our primary focus. More importantly, we want to have fun and encourage our members and visitors to try operating VHF and above. We encourage you to come visit the station and try your hand at operating, even if it's only for a short time. VHF contests have a much more relaxed pace than HF contests, so anyone should be able to participate. No contesting experience is required.

We'll be active on all bands from 50 MHz through to 24 GHz. Please contact us during the contest if you're able to do so, whether from your home station or as a rover. Every contact makes the contest more interesting and helps us increase our score.

More information about the contest can be found below.
